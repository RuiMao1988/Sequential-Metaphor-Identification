"a1j-fragment33","494","The Labour Party Conference : Policy review M_throws a M_spanner M_in the Whitehall M_machinery"
"a1j-fragment33","495","By COLIN HUGHES , Political Correspondent"
"a1j-fragment33","496","AN M_INCOMING Labour government would M_turn large areas of Whitehall M_upside M_down — but the party 's policy review barely M_considers the implications of its M_plans for restructuring government departments ."
"a1j-fragment33","497","M_Scattered M_through the policy review are proposals to : Drastically alter the M_status and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry ; Create two departments — a Department of Consumer Affairs , and a Department for Legal Administration ; Create a Department of Environmental Protection M_within the existing Department of the Environment ; M_Set M_up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ; M_Set M_up a Women 's Ministry ."
"a1j-fragment33","498","M_Those are only the most overt changes advocated M_in the review papers ."
"a1j-fragment33","499","The only department which explicitly M_escapes unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolish : the Department of Energy ."
"a1j-fragment33","500","M_In virtually every case the M_aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared , because Labour 's M_aim would be to M_upset the bureaucratic M_order it M_inherits ."
"a1j-fragment33","501","New departments and quangos would , according to the review , be M_designed to M_act as M_irritants and antagonists M_within the Civil Service M_system ."
"a1j-fragment33","502","But the policy review M_nowhere M_considers the overall effect of the individual changes proposed , or how they might be M_co-ordinated ."
"a1j-fragment33","503","Nor does it M_contemplate the knock-on consequences for Labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while M_rebuilding the governmental M_machine ."
"a1j-fragment33","504","The ‘ medium term industrial strategy ’ which would form the M_centrepiece of Labour 's economic policy would , according to the Productive and Competitive Economy review group , be ‘ administered by a transformed Department of Trade and Industry ’ ."
"a1j-fragment33","505","The review M_adds : ‘ What we now M_seek is a DTI which will M_have an equal , if not superior M_status , to M_that of the Treasury . ’"
"a1j-fragment33","506","M_That M_approach would M_seek to M_knock M_out a M_keystone of Civil Service tradition ."
"a1j-fragment33","507","Labour policy has long M_sought to M_challenge the Treasury 's dominance M_in government ."
"a1j-fragment33","508","But its last effort — the Department of Economic Affairs , M_set M_up by Harold Wilson and M_headed by George Brown — ended M_in futile departmental and ministerial infighting ."
"a1j-fragment33","509","There would in addition be a minister for Science and Technology M_at the newly M_supreme DTI , M_with responsibility for M_determing investment M_in research ."
"a1j-fragment33","510","There is no M_mention M_in the education policy of how M_that might affect the Department of Education and Science ."
"a1j-fragment33","511","But while the DTI would M_override the Treasury , a new ‘ M_powerful Department of Consumer Affairs ’ would M_antagonise the DTI ."
"a1j-fragment33","512","It would be M_headed by ‘ a minister of Cabinet M_rank ’ and M_act as ‘ the consumers ’ M_voice M_with other government departments ' ."
"a1j-fragment33","513","Its remit for inter-departmental M_intrusion would be M_wide , M_with ‘ a M_watching M_brief M_over government action ’ and the M_ability to initiate consumer legislation ."
"a1j-fragment33","514","Only the Women 's Ministry would be M_given equal license ."
"a1j-fragment33","515","It would be M_able to ‘ M_require each government department to review its policies , practices , and existing and proposed legislation ’ ."
"a1j-fragment33","516","While new departments are M_born and others M_extended , one of the M_oldest — the Home Office — would become a M_shadow of its M_present M_self ."
"a1j-fragment33","517","Labour 's proposed Department for Legal Administration would M_take M_over responsibility for courts and tribunals ; court procedures ; organisation , training and appointment of the legal profession , magistracy and judiciary ; legal aid ; legal services ; and the Sentencing Council ."
"a1j-fragment33","518","M_That would M_leave the Home Office M_with policing , penal policy and the criminal law ."
"a1j-fragment33","519","Responsibility for the Sex Discrimination Act , the Equal Pay Act and the Equal Opportunities Commission would be M_given M_to the Women 's Ministry ."
"a1j-fragment33","520","The concept of a minister M_having Cabinet M_rank — and therefore implicitly not being a M_member of the Cabinet M_proper — crops up again M_on environment ."
"a1j-fragment33","521","A ‘ new Minister of Environmental Protection ’ would M_operate M_inside the DoE ."
"a1j-fragment33","522","M_That could M_work — though it is easy to imagine M_conflicts of M_interest M_with the housing and planning functions of the department ."
"a1j-fragment33","523","More problematic will be Labour 's M_plan for the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ."
"a1j-fragment33","524","‘ The priority of MAFF must become food , not farming , ’ the policy review M_says ."
"a1j-fragment33","525","‘ Its main M_concerns would become food and the people who consume it , not farming and those who produce it . ’"
"a1j-fragment33","526","But the regulatory functions M_over the food industry , now M_split M_between MAFF and the Department of Health , would M_transfer M_to a new Food M_Standards Agency ."
"a1j-fragment33","527","M_That is the first of many agencies , executives , commissions , and other quango-like M_bodies M_recommended by the review ."
"a1j-fragment33","528","M_In some cases Labour 's quangos M_merge existing ones , or M_replace well-established M_bodies ."
"a1j-fragment33","529","The funding of M_higher education would become the responsibility of one M_body , rather than two ."
"a1j-fragment33","530","Labour 's Quality Commission would M_replace the Audit Commission ."
"a1j-fragment33","531","But there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utility , along with ombudsmen , and public M_interest commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State ."
"a1j-fragment33","532","There would be Skills UK — a locally structured training commission — a M_Fair Wages Commission , a Health Technology Commission , a Health Quality Commission , an Education M_Standards Council , an Independent Sentencing Council , a Children 's Commissioner , an Environmental Protection Executive , and a Social Insurance Fund M_administered by … ‘ an independent commission ’ ."
"a1u-fragment04","55","An M_atmosphere M_poisoned by mistrust"
"a1u-fragment04","56","By NICHOLAS ROE"
"a1u-fragment04","57","The disposal of toxic wastes is one of the most M_intractable problems M_facing industrialised societies ."
"a1u-fragment04","58","Even though some of the most dangerous and M_persistent toxins , including polychlorinated biphenyls , PCBs , are no longer manufactured , quantities of them still exist , and must be M_got rid of ."
"a1u-fragment04","59","But how ?"
"a1u-fragment04","60","And where ?"
"a1u-fragment04","61","M_On M_this page , Nick Roe visits a M_plant which , despite strenuous public relations efforts , has M_failed to M_convince its neighbours that it has M_come M_clean ."
"a1u-fragment04","62","And Richard North M_looks M_at current provisions for the destruction of PCBs , and M_at the history of British involvement M_in a rather M_uncomfortable growth industry The security guard at the entrance to one of Britain 's mightiest hazardous waste disposal M_plants pressed a button and the gate opened ."
"a1u-fragment04","63","Then he pressed another knob and a big toy doll in his office window M_dropped its trousers ."
"a1u-fragment04","64","You had to laugh ."
"a1u-fragment04","65","Yet M_this was Rechem International 's M_high-temperature incineration M_plant at Pontypool in Gwent , South Wales ."
"a1u-fragment04","66","Hardly a laughing matter , surely ?"
"a1u-fragment04","67","Beyond the barrier M_lay some of the most toxic chemicals known , M_awaiting destruction by fire ."
"a1u-fragment04","68","What else ?"
"a1u-fragment04","69","A vast , smoke-blackened furnace ; 100 people to do the work ; M_massive investment — the company M_spent £2m last year M_on cleaning up smoke emissions ."
"a1u-fragment04","70","Plus a M_backdrop of houses M_covering the valley M_walls on either side , a reminder that wherever industrialised societies M_decide to M_deal M_with their most M_intractable problems , they are unlikely to M_find a place to do so which is not in somebody 's M_back M_yard ."
"a1u-fragment04","71","Britain M_grinds M_out almost five million tonnes of hazardous waste each year , of which M_about 63,000 tonnes are so difficult to store or treat that they are burnt M_at M_high temperatures here in Gwent or at one of three other M_centres : Ellesmere Port ; Fawley , near Southampton ; and the unfortunately named Killamarsh , near Sheffield ."
"a1u-fragment04","72","Five more incinerators currently proposed in various parts of the country will double capacity ."
"a1u-fragment04","73","Then there are the imports : 83,000 tonnes of toxic waste enter British ports annually for incineration or other treatment , a figure which has increased 20-fold M_in just eight years ."
"a1u-fragment04","74","M_In M_these environmentally M_conscious times , M_this is an M_uncomfortable growth industry ."
"a1u-fragment04","75","Liverpool dockers recently turned back parts of a 1,500-tonne consignment of Canadian PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls ) M_bound for M_this M_plant in Gwent ."
"a1u-fragment04","76","M_In doing so , they M_underlined a fact which is likely to M_attract more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to town , country to country : the waste M_chain is M_long ."
"a1u-fragment04","77","It snakes in and out of ports , along our M_busiest highways and through our most crowded cities ."
"a1u-fragment04","78","Anxieties which are currently M_felt most acutely by M_those living near destruction M_plants themselves may not always remain so localised ."
"a1u-fragment04","79","At Pontypool , the M_collision M_between a precise , scientific industry and a M_diffuse , unscientific local suspicion is M_painfully apparent ."
"a1u-fragment04","80","Local people mutter and march , M_make speeches and throw things ; staff M_face sarcasm in nearby pubs ; and for years there have been demands for a public inquiry ."
"a1u-fragment04","81","Rechem has M_responded M_with a rather M_desperate open-door policy M_aimed M_at M_soothing fears , and more recently by issuing M_about a dozen writs M_against the fiercest critics ."
"a1u-fragment04","82","‘ We are an M_aggressive company , ’ M_admitted David Wheeler , M_operations director at M_this M_plant and at Rechem 's other incinerator , at Fawley ."
"a1u-fragment04","83","For a place so hated , the Pontypool M_plant looks innocuous inside , like a M_cross M_between an oil refinery and a crematorium ."
"a1u-fragment04","84","Mr Wheeler , an engineer who worked for many years M_in the oil M_business , is a pleasant , slightly worried-looking man who can not M_bear the fact that no one seems to realise just what M_lengths he M_goes M_to in order to M_keep the M_plant squeaky clean and M_emission-free ."
"a1u-fragment04","85","In hard hats and M_protective glasses , we walked past the huge ‘ fume M_cupboard ’ where the most noxious barrels are opened , and arrived at the vast , closed M_mouth of the furnace itself ."
"a1u-fragment04","86","It was hot , but not burning ."
"a1u-fragment04","87","There was a fault on the computer governing the M_plant , said Mr Wheeler , and the fire had automatically M_shut M_down ."
"a1u-fragment04","88","M_These pipes M_stretching thinly M_in a M_bridge across the service road M_injected a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itself ; did I know that fuel was only used M_in the start-up process , M_after which the chemicals themselves provided the fire ?"
"a1u-fragment04","89","Workers in blue overalls M_drifted around us and M_cracked jokes M_in M_gentle Welsh accents ."
"a1u-fragment04","90","In the furnace control office I found M_shift foreman Keith Thomas and asked innocently if he M_had any physical problems : ‘ Not since my vasectomy . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","91","A grin ."
"a1u-fragment04","92","He lived locally , so how did neighbours M_view his job here ?"
"a1u-fragment04","93","‘ You M_get sarcasm mainly ."
"a1u-fragment04","94","A M_lot of my friends are pleased that the company is M_doing the job they are doing ."
"a1u-fragment04","95","Others are not so well informed ."
"a1u-fragment04","96","You could n't hope to M_convert them . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","97","At a nearby house , Leonard Hough , a retired schoolmaster , had earlier told me M_about ‘ the fog ’ which he says M_comes from the factory ."
"a1u-fragment04","98","‘ It M_blows along the valley ."
"a1u-fragment04","99","They 've improved the chimney recently and it 's very much better than it was but we still M_get the smells ."
"a1u-fragment04","100","And since they 've refused repeatedly to M_have a public inquiry M_into what is M_going M_on there we 're not certain of the safety of what 's M_coming out ."
"a1u-fragment04","101","We M_get smoke from the steel works across the valley , but we know what M_that is and we 're not afraid of it . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","102","Keith Thomas pressed a button and a huge door clanked upwards so that I could peer into the M_heart of the furnace ."
"a1u-fragment04","103","Piles of ruddy-brown ash M_lay heaped on the floor ."
"a1u-fragment04","104","Pumps M_sucked air inwards ."
"a1u-fragment04","105","Heat shone out ."
"a1u-fragment04","106","M_In M_here , they burn M_about 30,000 tonnes of chemicals a year , a M_quarter originating outside Britain ."
"a1u-fragment04","107","The waste arrives M_at the M_rate of M_up M_to seven tanker-loads every day — M_that is seven lorries passing thousands of doorsteps ."
"a1u-fragment04","108","Right M_here , in M_this M_gaping M_mouth , M_lies the M_end of the M_chain ."
"a1u-fragment04","109","The wastes include lindane , DDT , out-of-date drugs , carcinogenic chemicals , old cigars and even pornography ( a different kind of M_pollution ) ."
"a1u-fragment04","110","M_About 7,000 tonnes of the total waste is PCB-contaminated ."
"a1u-fragment04","111","PCBs are so difficult to destroy , that Rechem 's emission-monitoring systems are geared M_to detecting them M_on the M_grounds that if you destroy PCBs you destroy everything ."
"a1u-fragment04","112","M_This , of course , is a key M_point ."
"a1u-fragment04","113","If you did not burn chemicals like PCBs , what else would you do M_with them ?"
"a1u-fragment04","114","The sea ?"
"a1u-fragment04","115","The earth ?"
"a1u-fragment04","116","‘ We are not M_in the M_business of polluting the environment , ’ Mr Wheeler insisted ."
"a1u-fragment04","117","‘ We are M_on the M_side of the M_angels . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","118","Environmental organisations , however , M_put the M_emphasis M_elsewhere ."
"a1u-fragment04","119","‘ There is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes , ’ Madeleine Cobbing , Greenpeace 's toxics campaigner , told me ."
"a1u-fragment04","120","‘ The crux of our argument is that we do n't need to M_have toxic wastes and the fact that M_plants like Rechem exist , providing easy options for companies , is M_acting as a disincentive for companies to M_clean M_up . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","121","But — another but — what M_about the PCBs that already exist ?"
"a1u-fragment04","122","Although they are no longer manufactured , they are still present , for example in electrical equipment ."
"a1u-fragment04","123","No one could therefore M_call for the closure of incineration M_plants M_at a M_stroke , because noxious chemicals have to M_go somewhere ."
"a1u-fragment04","124","So a M_part of the argument M_switches M_to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is M_forced to M_clean itself M_up ."
"a1u-fragment04","125","Also , how M_these should function and — perhaps most important of all — where you put them ."
"a1u-fragment04","126","Mr Wheeler , now moving to the rear of the M_plant to show off the £2m smoke-cleaning M_section , which had just broken down , M_pointed M_out that his company M_achieved destruction of at least 99.9999 per cent of all materials ."
"a1u-fragment04","127","The company 's figures imply that when you have burnt 99.9999 per cent of a 30,000-tonne annual throughput , a figure of 0.03 of a tonne M_remains ."
"a1u-fragment04","128","M_In 1986 , according to M_Friends of the Earth , a M_survey of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills M_found that three-quarters of 800 residents were opposed M_to the Rechem M_plant ."
"a1u-fragment04","129","‘ The M_plant should be relocated because it 's in the wrong place , ’ Llew Smith , the local Euro-MP , told me ."
"a1u-fragment04","130","‘ It is in a valley and in a highly populated area . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","131","What did Mr Wheeler M_make of M_that ?"
"a1u-fragment04","132","‘ If we do it properly any spot is the right spot , ’ he insisted ."
"a1u-fragment04","133","M_Stack emissions of PCBs were M_below the American M_standard for breathing air - 1,000 times M_lower than the British equivalent ."
"a1u-fragment04","134","Regular soil and grass tests M_showed no difference M_between PCB contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in Wales — though there are no established ‘ safe ’ M_levels for M_these ."
"a1u-fragment04","135","Five air-monitoring M_plants had been installed ( he took me to see them ) ."
"a1u-fragment04","136","And here were drums of chemicals , each labelled , each with a job number to check M_against sampling ."
"a1u-fragment04","137","And yet there are accidents ."
"a1u-fragment04","138","M_In 1987 , aluminium melted in the furnace , M_reacted M_with water and exploded , M_sending a black cloud over nearby houses ."
"a1u-fragment04","139","Later , drums supposedly containing carcinogenic drugs were not opened for checking M_before burning ( for health reasons ) and three were ‘ misdescribed ’ ."
"a1u-fragment04","140","They , too , reacted M_with water , and a M_plant operator was burned by a M_cloud of acid gas ."
"a1u-fragment04","141","We walked past a tanker where a huge man named Andy Matthews was pumping vinyl acetate into a 10,000-gallon vat , M_wreathed M_in its M_sweet , M_sickly smell : ‘ I 've been here two years , ’ he said ."
"a1u-fragment04","142","‘ My father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them , go and work for them . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","143","Were there any spillages ?"
"a1u-fragment04","144","He shrugged ."
"a1u-fragment04","145","‘ Nothing major ."
"a1u-fragment04","146","I might drop a pipe — a little M_bit of a splash . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","147","In a large , prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of 45-gallon drums of PCBs , two drums high , M_about 10 deep ; and there were contaminated transformers M_waiting to be M_cut M_up and M_roasted in the flames ."
"a1u-fragment04","148","M_Back M_along the waste M_chain , the Liverpool dockers who objected M_to the import of exactly M_this type of chemical should be aware that PCBs are M_moving about our roads all the time ."
"a1u-fragment04","149","There was no difference M_between the liquid in M_these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch ."
"a1u-fragment04","150","In Liverpool , a dockers ' spokesman M_with the Transport and General Workers Union admitted : ‘ Drivers are n't happy handling some of M_these commodities , but at least a lorry-driver M_has more idea of what he is handling than a docker , who could M_have a consignment and just not know what it is . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","151","Yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement ( M_after all , the same union represents workers at Rechem itself ) ; he simply did n't like the idea that M_big industrial nations like Canada could M_dump their M_dirty problems M_on M_this country and his M_members ."
"a1u-fragment04","152","Driving away , I noticed that the vast chimney was still not functioning , but when I M_called at a neighbouring house a woman showed me videos she had M_taken of smoke M_coming from the M_plant , M_settling in her garden ."
"a1u-fragment04","153","Certainly the incinerator seems well controlled ."
"a1u-fragment04","154","Certainly there is no scientific evidence that living nearby increases the risk of sickness ."
"a1u-fragment04","155","Certainly , Mr Wheeler convinced me that his company was M_going M_to M_huge M_lengths to M_keep itself clean ."
"a1u-fragment04","156","‘ We must M_run it safely M_in the M_short term and M_long term , ’ he said , ‘ because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be M_shut M_down . ’"
"a1u-fragment04","157","M_In April 1985 a tanker M_spilled 200 litres of PCBs over the main Trans-Canada Highway on the border between Ontario and Manitoba ."
"a1u-fragment04","158","A M_section of the road was M_shut for a week and motorists were warned to clean their cars and to dispose of the rags in plastic bags ."

"a31-fragment03","115","WHEN M_things go wrong you can sue more often than you may think ."
"a31-fragment03","116","Money may not have M_changed M_hands ."
"a31-fragment03","117","Someone may have even done you a favour ."
"a31-fragment03","118","It does n't matter ."
"a31-fragment03","119","As long as you can M_show that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent , damages could M_come your M_way ."
"a31-fragment03","120","There are a number of M_points to M_bear M_in mind ."
"a31-fragment03","121","Take up references M_before M_giving credit , lending money , letting in tenants , taking on staff ."
"a31-fragment03","122","M_Ask banks , building societies , former landlords , M_present and past employers ."
"a31-fragment03","123","If you rely M_to your detriment M_on a misleading reference which was M_given negligently , you should be able to sue the referee ."
"a31-fragment03","124","The M_subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to M_show the referee was M_upM_to no good : spite , M_ill-will or some improper motive will M_do ."
"a31-fragment03","125","Take M_along a prosperous M_adviser M_on all shopping sprees , demonstrate a M_high M_degree of trust and M_strong reliance M_in what they say and you may M_have unexpected protection should the seller go M_out M_of business and the goods M_fall M_to M_pieces ."
"a31-fragment03","126","A 26-year-old woman accountant who knew nothing M_about the mechanical M_side of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her ."
"a31-fragment03","127","She stipulated that it must never have been involved M_in an accident ."
"a31-fragment03","128","The friend found one at a garage ."
"a31-fragment03","129","Although he failed to check it had been accident-free , he assured the lady that M_this was the case ."
"a31-fragment03","130","She M_bought it ."

"a31-fragment03","132","M_In May last year the Court of Appeal upheld a judgment M_against the friend for more than £5,500 damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care ."
"a31-fragment03","133","Your conservatory collapses as a result of negligence of the professionals who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up ."
"a31-fragment03","134","You can sue the professionals — builders , architects , surveyors or engineers — by M_courtesy of the Defective Premises Act 1972 , despite the fact that you never M_had a contract M_with them yourself ."
"a31-fragment03","135","There are M_strict time limits : generally , six years M_from when damage first M_occurred ; M_where the damage was initially ‘ latent ’ you are M_given longer — three years M_from when you could have discovered it , M_with a M_longM_stop of 15 years ."
"a31-fragment03","136","It may also be possible to claim damages M_against a local authority for negligently M_failing to ensure that construction work M_complied M_with the relevant building regulations ."
"a31-fragment03","137","A solicitor fails to draw up a will M_within a M_reasonable time for a client who subsequently dies ."

"a31-fragment03","140","When you want to borrow M_on a mortgage , the prospective lenders will M_have the property valued M_at your expense ."
"a31-fragment03","141","There is no contract M_between you and the valuer ."
"a31-fragment03","142","But if the valuer is negligent and you buy the property relying M_on his report , you may still be able to sue him for damages ."
"a31-fragment03","143","M_This is what the House of Lords M_decided M_in two cases last April in spite of an attempt to M_get the valuers M_off the M_hook by a disclaimer which M_said : ‘ I accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated M_in his report as being M_accurate …"

"a36-fragment07","179","BOOK REVIEW / The cause M_without a rebel : ‘ The Pale Companion ’ — Andrew Motion : Viking , 11.95 pounds"
"a36-fragment07","180","By MARTIN PACEY"
"a36-fragment07","181","IT WAS unfair of Auden to M_suggest , M_in his ‘ Letter to Lord Byron ’ , that a poet 's ‘ M_sense of other people 's very M_hazy ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","182","But the M_vaporous M_presences that M_float M_through M_this M_slender and M_anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to M_support the claim ."
"a36-fragment07","183","The book — which M_opens a M_projected sequence of novels that will M_cover the period M_from 1968 M_to the M_present day — M_aims to M_explore what the blurb M_describes as ‘ the M_painful transition M_from youth M_to adulthood ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","184","M_This , of course , is a popular M_subject : it seems particularly M_attractive M_to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the M_tremulously M_sensitive M_probing of feelings ."
"a36-fragment07","185","M_Sensitivity , though , is not enough ."
"a36-fragment07","186","What Andrew Motion M_presents us M_with M_here is a static and M_humourless M_mood-piece M_filled M_with M_over-elaborate M_imagery ."
"a36-fragment07","187","The hero , Francis Mayne , is suffering M_from the adolescent 's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness ."
"a36-fragment07","188","He M_finds it M_hard to communicate M_with people , not least his separated parents ."
"a36-fragment07","189","His father is a faceless figure : a retired brigadier , M_reserved and taciturn ."
"a36-fragment07","190","His mother , by M_contrast , is the most M_vividly realised character M_in the book : nervy , flirtatious and selfish , already M_on her third husband , she thinks primarily of her appearance , even when visiting her dying daughter , Francis 's twin ."
"a36-fragment07","191","The first half of the novel is M_dominated by the girl 's death M_from leukaemia ."
"a36-fragment07","192","There is a M_refreshing simplicity and M_tenderness M_in Motion 's M_account of the M_way Francis nurses her , but she herself is too sketchily M_drawn for the episode to M_carry much M_weight ."
"a36-fragment07","193","Meanwhile , M_at his public school , Francis is M_conducting a love-affair with an older pupil named Keith Ogilvie ."
"a36-fragment07","194","He is finally rejected by the M_devious , arrogant Keith , who informs him that he is ‘ M_obsolete ’ because he does not ‘ know how to M_make M_things happen ’ ."
"a36-fragment07","195","His M_response M_to M_this rejection is as M_flat as his M_reaction M_to the M_massive demonstration which Keith has earlier persuaded him to M_join M_against the Vietnam War ."
"a36-fragment07","196","M_This M_violent event , described at length M_in M_hysterically M_colourful terms , is the only M_piece of history to be M_woven convincingly M_into the M_plot ."
"a36-fragment07","197","Other M_broad hints as to the date are M_inserted M_with a comical lack of subtlety : ‘ My God , darling , have you heard ? ’ exclaims Francis 's mother one day as she greets him , ‘ Czechoslovakia ."
"a36-fragment07","198","It 's been invaded . ’"
"a36-fragment07","199","Motion will have to do better than M_this if he seriously intends his series of novels to M_capture the M_feel of a period ."
"a36-fragment07","200","But the book 's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist ."
"a36-fragment07","201","M_In his eagerness to depict the M_cloudy psychology of an adolescent , Motion has forgotten to M_give the boy a personality ."
"a36-fragment07","202","He has , however , M_given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes ."
"a36-fragment07","203","Hardly a page M_goes M_by M_without the hapless Francis noticing something which reminds him , improbably , of something else ."
"a36-fragment07","204","Sometimes he is reminded of several M_things ."
"a36-fragment07","205","One moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks ‘ like a M_child 's M_drawing of M_ghosts ’ ; the M_next it appears ‘ frightening but derelict , like M_extinguished M_chandeliers ’ ; and finally the chestnuts ‘ M_prance M_at him , M_holding M_up their gleaming branches like M_hysterics . ’"
"a36-fragment07","206","Such writing rapidly palls , and I hope that M_in the novels to M_come , Motion can curb his reckless passion for it ."

"a3m-fragment02","45","Design : M_Crossed M_lines M_over the toytown tram : City transport could soon be M_back M_on the right M_track , says Jonathan Glancey"
"a3m-fragment02","46","By JONATHAN GLANCEY"
"a3m-fragment02","47","MODERN trams , as most continental Europeans know , neither shake nor rattle , nor do they roll ."
"a3m-fragment02","48","M_Sleek , solidly built , M_gentle M_on the environment , they are often an ideal M_form of city transport ."
"a3m-fragment02","49","They also M_exert a fascination very much of their own as they M_slither round circuses and M_brush through old city gates , flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks M_on winter nights ."
"a3m-fragment02","50","Single-car , articulated or double-decker , trams are one of the most reliable and enduring M_forms of public transport invented ."
"a3m-fragment02","51","The M_orange-liveried ‘ 1500 ’ series trams in Milan , for example , date M_from 1927 ."
"a3m-fragment02","52","Eventually they will be replaced , but more than 60 years M_on they M_run M_with the M_rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watch ."
"a3m-fragment02","53","They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele ."
"a3m-fragment02","54","Last month it was announced that Britain will M_get its first M_new-wave trams M_in 1991 ."
"a3m-fragment02","55","M_Destined to M_run in Manchester , they will M_relieve traffic M_congestion and M_help to M_reduce the M_levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre , outlying suburbs and M_satellite towns of Bury , Altrincham , Salford , Oldham and Rochdale ."
"a3m-fragment02","56","In Britain , M_with the main exception of Blackpool ( not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno ) , trams had been largely relegated M_to the history books ."
"a3m-fragment02","57","Otherwise , the best place to see M_working trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else M_in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comedies ."
"a3m-fragment02","58","Trams disappeared from most British cities M_in the 1950s ."
"a3m-fragment02","59","London 's M_venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time M_in 1952 ."
"a3m-fragment02","60","Somehow the M_image of the tall , thin , M_mournful double-deck tram with its wooden M_body , slatted wooden seats and M_growling electric motor has M_stuck M_in the British M_mind ."
"a3m-fragment02","61","Trams , it was believed M_until surprisingly recently , are old-fashioned ."
"a3m-fragment02","62","They M_had something to M_do M_with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper , men in hats , National Health specs , smog and powdered egg ."
"a3m-fragment02","63","They M_held M_up the M_bright new diesel buses and , even worse , M_blocked the progress of private motorists in M_bulbous Austins and M_lumpen Humbers in M_canyon-like city thoroughfares ."
"a3m-fragment02","64","They M_picked M_up power from a M_spider 'M_s M_web of unsightly overhead wires ."
"a3m-fragment02","65","They were M_inflexible M_in M_operation , draughty , and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled ‘ Do Not Spit ’ signs screwed to their bulkheads ."
"a3m-fragment02","66","But the modern tram could hardly be more different ."
"a3m-fragment02","67","It M_plays a key M_role M_in M_keeping city streets M_on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers ' desire ."
"a3m-fragment02","68","In Milan , for example , the commission to design the new M_generation of ‘ Jumbo ’ trams , which M_went M_into service M_in 1979 , was one that M_leading Italian architects and designers M_fought M_over ."
"a3m-fragment02","69","M_After all , the Jumbo , a M_handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect , engineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenig , will be seen on the streets of Milan for the M_next M_half-century ."
"a3m-fragment02","70","Spotlessly clean and popular , the Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig 's design skills ."
"a3m-fragment02","71","The modern tram is a green machine ."
"a3m-fragment02","72","M_Assuming the power station at the end of the line M_burns cleanly , the tram is virtually pollution M_free ."
"a3m-fragment02","73","M_Standing at traffic lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo is , save for the chatter inside , completely silent ."
"a3m-fragment02","74","The overhead wires are so M_slight that you have to look M_hard to see them ."
"a3m-fragment02","75","Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable , the latter M_far M_greater than any car ."
"a3m-fragment02","76","But sadly , there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will M_design , M_operate and M_maintain the first of the new M_generation British trams in Manchester will M_share the looks of their Milanese counterparts ."
"a3m-fragment02","77","Artists ' M_impressions M_show a tram that M_has more in common with the M_flat-faced , characterless M_light trains of the M_toy-like Docklands Light Railway ."
"a3m-fragment02","78","There is still time for GMA ( GEC , Mowlem , Amec and Greater Manchester Buses ) to M_consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer ."
"a3m-fragment02","79","M_After all , Mancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at M_these mechanical M_millipedes for well M_into the twenty-first century ."
"a3m-fragment02","80","Now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they M_serve , Manchester M_has a chance to M_make a M_fresh M_start M_with its trams ."
"a3m-fragment02","81","Manchester is not M_alone ."
"a3m-fragment02","82","Other British towns , Croydon and Southampton M_among them , are also M_considering modern tramways ."
"a3m-fragment02","83","M_These are all referred M_to as ‘ supertram ’ networks , the implication being that the M_new-generation tram is an altogether more M_dynamic M_form of transport than its pre-war M_predecessors ."
"a3m-fragment02","84","What it really M_means is that the new trams are a M_hybrid M_between street car and lightweight suburban train ."
"a3m-fragment02","85","Although they will M_slip through the city centre M_serving the essential parts — shopping malls , leisure centres , theme parks , amusement arcades and museums — the Manchester supertrams will also M_head out of town on a M_mix of reserved track and existing railway lines ."
"a3m-fragment02","86","The supertram is , M_in effect , a M_low-cost replacement for British Rail 's M_ageing M_fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains , M_those M_rasping diesels which M_change gear M_to the M_accompaniment of M_voluminous M_clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the M_blessing of train spotters ."
"a3m-fragment02","87","They will M_perform some of the same functions , but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams ."
"a3m-fragment02","88","And although the supertram concept will M_spread through major cities during the M_next decade , Blackpool will still be alone M_in its M_use of traditional double-deckers ."

"a7w-fragment01","2","THIRTY FIVE people died and others were maimed for life M_in the Clapham rail disaster M_in December last year because work was done M_in a slovenly , haphazard M_way and was then M_left unchecked ."

"a7w-fragment01","7","M_This was a M_system M_hopelessly M_under M_strain ."
"a7w-fragment01","8","M_Under M_strain for a M_start because it was technically M_ill-equipped to M_avert disaster or to M_cope M_with the consequences when disaster M_struck ; M_under M_strain M_from commercial M_pressures which , as the inquiry M_puts it , ‘ M_compromised ’ safety ; M_under M_strain M_above all because the people on the spot could n't or would n't cope , were weary M_from gruesome working hours ( the M_senior signal technician who M_heads the list of the culpable had M_had only one day M_off M_in the past 13 weeks ) , lacked adequate M_training , or simply could n't be bothered ."

"a7w-fragment01","21","There was no service in London , M_with all 71 stations and 455 vehicles M_off M_the M_road ."
"a7w-fragment01","22","The only accident and emergency M_relief was provided by the police , part-time St John ambulance volunteers running 20 vehicles , and the Red Cross ."
"a7w-fragment01","23","Outside the capital , accident and emergency services were being provided in most areas , but the ban M_on emergency work was M_tightened ."
"a7w-fragment01","24","The service was M_facing its M_biggest M_crisis since the ambulances M_came M_to a stop M_in the Winter of Discontent ten years ago ."
"a7w-fragment01","25","Like Labour M_in 1979 , the Conservatives have M_put military ambulances M_on standby ."
"a7w-fragment01","26","They move in today ."
"a7w-fragment01","27","What has M_gone wrong ?"
"a7w-fragment01","28","There are three key causes of the M_shambles : Mr Kenneth Clarke ; the failure to M_separate emergency M_from non-emergency work ; and the Whitley Council negotiating M_machinery ."
"a7w-fragment01","29","The Health Secretary M_accused the unions of ‘ M_posturing and M_pretending ’ to M_run a 999 service yesterday ."
"a7w-fragment01","30","He was right ."
"a7w-fragment01","31","By refusing to M_keep M_open M_two-way radio M_links , the crews had effectively ended a proper emergency service ."
"a7w-fragment01","32","The M_move was M_signalled last week and , M_true M_to their promised M_response , management M_suspended the workers involved M_in the disruption ."
"a7w-fragment01","33","But ‘ M_posturing and M_pretending ’ M_went M_far M_beyond the unions ."
"a7w-fragment01","34","Mr Clarke has been indulging M_in just M_that himself , M_putting M_up the luckless Duncan Nichol , chief executive of the health service , to M_take the initial M_flak M_under the pretence that the dispute is not his M_direct responsibility ."
"a7w-fragment01","35","Yet it was Mr Clarke , not Mr Nichol , who was involved M_in the M_critical decisions — the cash M_limit for the NHS , the 6.5 per cent offer M_to ambulance workers ( M_compared M_to seven per cent for nurses , eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers ) ; and today 's M_introduction of military ambulances ."
"a7w-fragment01","36","Ambulance workers M_on emergency work do deserve a much M_higher increase ."
"a7w-fragment01","37","They have M_progressed M_far M_beyond routine first aid ."
"a7w-fragment01","38","Their paramedical skills M_cover highly technical procedures : intubation , infusion and defebrillation ."
"a7w-fragment01","39","The M_crews are M_able to resuscitate heart attack patients , replace fluid intraveneously M_after M_severe blood loss , and insert tubes to maintain air supplies in unconconscious casualties ."
"a7w-fragment01","40","Yet the ambulance worker is only being offered £10,000 , when a fire officer is being given £13,000 and a Metropolitan police constable can earn £25,000 ."
"a7w-fragment01","41","But only two million M_out M_of the 20 million journeys which ambulance M_crews M_carry M_out each year are emergency calls ."
"a7w-fragment01","42","Nine M_out M_of 10 are routine M_calls , many of which could be M_carried M_out by mini cabs ."
"a7w-fragment01","43","Mr Duncan Nichol wants to M_separate the emergency M_from the non-emergency work ."
"a7w-fragment01","44","He is right to M_pursue M_this M_line ."
"a7w-fragment01","45","Wiltshire and Northumbria have already M_shown how much can be achieved ."
"a7w-fragment01","46","The M_ramshackle Whitley Council negotiating M_machinery is the other reason why the ambulance workers have lost out ."
"a7w-fragment01","47","M_Until M_this year , the three independent review M_bodies which M_make recommendations for nurses , doctors and the professions M_allied M_to medicine have M_given much M_higher awards than the Whitley Councils ."
"a7w-fragment01","48","As Lord McCarthy M_noted some 13 years ago , the management M_side of the councils comprise ‘ employers who do not pay and paymasters who do not employ . ’"
"a7w-fragment01","49","A much more M_flexible M_system which would M_allow local managers to negotiate local rates — M_on a national pay M_spine — is needed ."

"a7w-fragment01","55","The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , the Hong Kong Island Divisional M_Headquarters of the Red Cross , the new Cultural M_Centre , and many more ."

"a7w-fragment01","57","It is all standard royal M_stuff , but not much help M_to the millions who fear that Hong Kong will not remain M_open M_after 1997 ."
"a7w-fragment01","58","The M_whole M_point of a visit to Hong Kong now , five months M_after Tiananmen Square , should be to declare M_with royal authority that Britain M_shares the concerns of the Hong Kong people and is M_determined to M_do something M_about them ."
"a7w-fragment01","59","There was already a rather perfunctory M_air M_to the Queen 's visit three years ago , as if it were just a required M_coda M_to her tour of China ."
"a7w-fragment01","60","When the Prince and Princess of Wales quite rightly M_scrapped their tour of the mainland , they M_had the opportunity to M_make a M_contrasting M_point in Hong Kong ."
"a7w-fragment01","61","Unless they can say something relevant M_in the M_next four days , the many Hong Kong critics who believe the visit is a M_waste of dollars will be absolutely right ."
"a7w-fragment01","62","It did not help at all that M_upon arrival yesterday the royal couple instantly M_touched M_base in M_that comforting M_symbol of past British M_power , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank ."
"a7w-fragment01","63","If there is a M_failure of imagination to use the royal visit creatively it will also be a M_failure of nerve ."
"a7w-fragment01","64","Britain still can not M_decide when to M_play the mandarinate M_game of silence M_with the Chinese and when to M_break the M_rules ( as Beijing does all the time . )"
"a7w-fragment01","65","The ideal M_tactics should be a M_mixture of both , but only if a M_clear M_message can be M_communicated M_to the Hong Kong people that someone is M_standing M_up for them somewhere ."
"a7w-fragment01","66","Instead the latest developments M_in Sino-British relations have M_left them even more confused than M_before ."
"a7w-fragment01","67","China M_claims that the Hong Kong Government recently M_gave a written commitment to M_limit the activities of the pro-democracy M_movement in the territory ."
"a7w-fragment01","68","The government M_denies M_this , but has M_published the text of a letter from its Political Adviser M_to the New China News Agency ( Beijing 's embassy in Hong Kong ) M_suggesting that it did ."
"a7w-fragment01","69","M_In a M_tone of M_meek M_appeasement , the letter M_draws attention M_to the arrest by Hong Kong police of anti-China demonstrators outside the agency 's National Day reception ."
"a7w-fragment01","70","It also M_reminds Beijing that permission has been refused for local protesters to erect a replica Statue of Democracy on a permanent site ."
"a7w-fragment01","71","It ends by M_assuring Beijing that the Hong Kong Government will M_have ‘ a M_prudent regard for the special circumstances of Hong Kong and the interests and concerns of the Chinese Government . ’"
"a7w-fragment01","72","Meanwhile the M_flood of letters of a very different sort M_from anxious Hong Kong citizens M_to M_this and every other newspaper office continues ."
"a7w-fragment01","73","So do the Chinese press statements M_asserting that Hong Kong is ‘ entirely a M_business M_between China and Britain ’ and should not be M_discussed , formally or informally , M_at any international M_forum ."
"a7w-fragment01","74","The only two Hong Kong legislators who consistently dare to speak out , Mr Martin Lee and Mr Szeto Wah , have been threatened M_with M_expulsion M_from the committee now drafting China 's post-1997 Basic Law ."
"a7w-fragment01","75","Our latest Foreign Secretary has yet to publicly pick up the file marked Hong Kong ."

"aa3-fragment08","215","GEORGE Tyson is not a M_gambling man nor does he M_take unnecessary risks ."
"aa3-fragment08","216","He does n't smoke or drink , and even if he wanted to , two heart attacks and a by-pass operation have M_made the M_decision for him ."
"aa3-fragment08","217","By his own M_account , Mr Tyson is thrifty and states quite proudly that neither he or his wife Rosie are a M_burden M_on any M_form of social or government M_support ."
"aa3-fragment08","218","But M_that is why , M_at the age of 68 , Mr Tyson is not enjoying what he had hoped would be a M_comfortable retirement ."
"aa3-fragment08","219","A life of M_saving had , M_by 1985 , M_given them a small nest-egg of £15,000 M_on which the interest would M_help supplement their pensions ."
"aa3-fragment08","220","M_To the Tysons , M_that M_meant nothing extravagant — just an extra £135 a month to M_make life M_at M_home in South Ruislip , Middlesex easier ."
"aa3-fragment08","221","M_That money was invested as might be expected of the Tysons ."
"aa3-fragment08","222","And for three years , it M_earned its M_return , every month ."
"aa3-fragment08","223","M_Until one morning M_in June 1988 when George Tyson turned on the radio to hear a small , investment business called Barlow Clowes had M_collapsed ."
"aa3-fragment08","224","‘ It was M_about 8.30am and I was just getting dressed when it M_came M_over M_on the news , ’ said Mr Tyson , a former clerk of works at Harrow council , London ."
"aa3-fragment08","225","Investors M_in Barlow Clowes since 1985 , the Tysons had orginally M_put £10,000 M_into the UK fund and £5,000 M_in Gibraltar-based Barlow Clowes International ( BCI ) ."
"aa3-fragment08","226","Fate determined that a M_short while before the businesses M_failed , they M_transferred the £10,000 M_to BCI because of the better M_returns being offered ."
"aa3-fragment08","227","M_In the days that M_followed , the Tysons M_found that they and 18,000 other investors had been the M_victims of a financial M_crash of global proportions ."
"aa3-fragment08","228","Of the £190million invested in both funds , BCI investors M_faced a shortfall of up to £100million ."
"aa3-fragment08","229","M_After the initial M_shock and disbelief , the Tysons grew angry — M_at the advisers who convinced them M_about Barlow Clowes , M_at the Midland bank manager who M_gave verbal assurances of its M_security , M_at the regulatory authorities M_responsible for the investment M_community and M_at the Department of Trade and Industry which M_allowed the company to trade ."
"aa3-fragment08","230","‘ I M_felt it was so M_safe , they were so professional , ’ said Mr Tyson ."
"aa3-fragment08","231","‘ I M_feel appalled by the M_way M_these professional guardians have treated us ."
"aa3-fragment08","232","If you were a M_gambling man it would not affect you , it would just be M_lost ."
"aa3-fragment08","233","But M_this was not a M_gamble . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","234","Like so many investors , Mr Tyson M_found himself having to go back M_to work to M_ease the financial M_strain he had hoped to M_avoid ."
"aa3-fragment08","235","Ironically , it was the Government which he partly blamed for the affair that M_gave him the chance to M_return M_to work M_after retirement ."
"aa3-fragment08","236","A change M_in the tax rules affecting pensions was shortly M_followed by a job M_with the Department of Environment 's Property Services Agency , a post which carries him through M_to March and may M_see him M_stay until he is 70 ."
"aa3-fragment08","237","M_Putting it as politely as he can , Mr Tyson said the M_whole affair ‘ M_encouraged ’ him to M_return M_to paid employment ."
"aa3-fragment08","238","‘ I had n't M_planned to work at all . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","239","And like all of the other investors , he and his wife were M_in a quandry ."
"aa3-fragment08","240","They wanted to do something but M_felt powerless ."
"aa3-fragment08","241","M_Pursuing legal action would have cost them money they did n't have ( unless it M_meant selling their house which was not an option ) but doing nothing M_left them M_with the M_feeling that justice was n't being done ."
"aa3-fragment08","242","So they compromised and gave £100 M_to the Barlow Clowes Investors Group which was M_formed last July to M_represent the investors ' interests and M_co-ordinate the M_fight for compensation ."
"aa3-fragment08","243","M_That , says Mr Tyson , has been their only M_blessing ."
"aa3-fragment08","244","‘ They are dedicated people who clearly know what they are M_talking M_about and have M_guided us M_through it ."
"aa3-fragment08","245","M_Those people are M_victims , too , but they have certainly M_kept us M_together . ’"
"aa3-fragment08","246","M_That M_aside , the last year has M_brought little respite M_from their own , very personal , M_crisis ."
"aa3-fragment08","247","The Tysons have yet to see any cash payment from the liquidators who have been M_winding M_up BCI 's affairs ."
"aa3-fragment08","248","What little money has been recovered remains the M_subject of a legal M_tussle M_in the courts which may yet M_take months to resolve ."
"aa3-fragment08","249","They have been told that their claim may only amount M_to M_around £11,000 of their £15,000 as capital gains tax is likely to be deducted M_from the total ."
"aa3-fragment08","250","But until they get any money back , the Tysons M_find themselves M_in the M_position of the M_gambler who M_gambled all and M_lost ."
"aa3-fragment08","251","Except that the Tysons do n't M_gamble ."

"ahc-fragment61","1262","My passion is for its numerous Romanesque churches , M_in most cases M_humbly proportioned but M_elevated M_into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely-sculpted decoration ; to go to Poitou/Saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be like M_going M_to an M_African M_game M_reserve and M_ignoring the M_animals ."
"ahc-fragment61","1263","For M_serious drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around Cognac , plus the chance to sample pineau , the M_powerful local aperitif made from M_young wine M_laced with cognac ."

"b17-fragment02","170","PART 2 Sociology and crime"
"b17-fragment02","171","Explaining crime : theories of criminality"
"b17-fragment02","172","Most people M_have their own notions or theories as to what causes criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","173","For example , lack of discipline M_in the home , genetic defects , poverty , M_mixing with the ‘ wrong sort ’ have all been proposed as causes of criminality ."
"b17-fragment02","174","While such notions may all M_contains some M_elements of truth , they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","175","M_This chapter will M_examine a M_range of theories which M_attempt to explain such behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","176","Although the major theoretical explanations are M_covered M_in the numerous M_introductions M_to the sociology of crime and deviance and M_to sociology generally , some review of these theories is necessary before M_embarking M_upon an examination of specific , substantive examples of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","177","As M_this is not a book M_on criminological theories , what M_follows will be a M_brief overview of a M_wide M_range of theories and explanations ."
"b17-fragment02","178","First , a word of warning might be M_in M_order ."
"b17-fragment02","179","It would be naive to expect to M_uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour , given the M_extensive and diverse behaviour that is M_encompassed by the term crime ."
"b17-fragment02","180","Suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision ."
"b17-fragment02","181","It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another ."
"b17-fragment02","182","Also , there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision ."
"b17-fragment02","183","Perhaps M_this was because of their M_poor living conditions which would M_raise the question of why they were M_in M_poor housing ."
"b17-fragment02","184","Was M_this because of governmental housing policy or a M_poor employment record on the part of the bread-winner of the family ?"
"b17-fragment02","185","M_Clearly , we are M_getting M_further and M_further M_away M_from the causes of delinquent behaviour , and it is perhaps wisest to think in terms of causal processes when M_looking M_at criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","186","Biological and psychological theories"
"b17-fragment02","187","Before examining the major sociological M_on crime , it is useful to refer M_to theories M_from M_outside M_of sociology , M_from other academic disciplines ."
"b17-fragment02","188","Thus , we will M_look initially M_at biological and psychological theories ."
"b17-fragment02","189","Biological theories"
"b17-fragment02","190","Biological ( or physiological ) explanations are M_based M_on the notion that some individuals are predisposed M_to criminal behaviour because of their genetic M_make-up ."
"b17-fragment02","191","The individual criminal is born so ; and M_this is usually M_put M_down M_to ‘ faulty chromosome M_patterns ’ , or , more vaguely , to ‘ M_hereditary traits ’ ."
"b17-fragment02","192","The most famous exponent of M_this M_approach was the nineteenth-century Italian physician , Cesare Lombroso ."
"b17-fragment02","193","M_In his book L'Uomo Delinquente , Lombroso developed a complex description of what he M_called the ‘ born criminal ’ , who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics , M_in particular facial characteristics — for example large jaws and ears , and high cheek bones ."
"b17-fragment02","194","In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to M_illustrate Lombroso 's theory ."
"b17-fragment02","195","To use his own language :"
"b17-fragment02","196","Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws , high cheek bones , prominent superciliary M_arches , M_solitary lines on the palms , extreme size of the M_orbits , M_handle-shaped or M_sessile ears M_found M_in criminals , M_savages and apes , insensibility of pain , extremely M_acute sight , tattooing , excessive idleness , love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake …"
"b17-fragment02","197","M_These explanations M_see the delinquent individual as inherently more M_prone M_to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent ."
"b17-fragment02","198","They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists ."
"b17-fragment02","199","Lombroso 's work , for example , was M_based M_on his examination of people in prison in Italy ."
"b17-fragment02","200","M_This would , necessarily , M_ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison , and that , perhaps , people in prison are not always criminal ."
"b17-fragment02","201","Most M_advocates of biological theories do not M_express themselves M_in the same bizarre language and style as Lombroso , and such theories of crime are not merely historical M_relics that M_died M_with Lombroso ."
"b17-fragment02","202","M_In a major study of institutionalised delinquents ( delinquents M_in some M_form of custody ) in the USA M_in the 1950s , Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck M_found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build , a chunky , muscular , compared M_with non-delinquent boys ."
"b17-fragment02","203","However , the fact that the study was M_restricted M_to institutionalised delinquents limits the validity of the M_association M_between body build and crime and delinquency ."
"b17-fragment02","204","It may be that M_tougher-looking delinquents are more liable M_to be M_put M_away than M_fragile looking ones ."
"b17-fragment02","205","Furthermore , it has been M_found that the M_association M_between delinquency M_on the one M_hand and height , weight and physique M_on the M_other is greatly M_reduced once social , M_background factors are M_taken M_into M_account ."
"b17-fragment02","206","For example , M_lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour , and M_this class grouping is more likely to be M_found represented M_in the criminal statistics ."
"b17-fragment02","207","With regard to the M_links M_between criminal behaviour and M_inherited characteristics , there have been a number of theoretical explanations M_suggesting an M_association M_between criminality and particular personality characteristics ."
"b17-fragment02","208","An example of M_this more M_sophisticated biological M_approach is the work of Hans Eysenck , who has argued M_in a series of studies , that there is a M_link M_between genetically based personality characteristics and criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","209","He M_maintains that there is a M_link M_between characteristics such as extroversion and criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","210","An individual 's M_degree of extroversion or introversion is M_inherited , M_determined by his or her genetic M_make-up ."
"b17-fragment02","211","The M_link M_with crime M_found by Eysenck was that when prisoners were tested for extroversion , more extroverts were M_found than M_in the general population ."
"b17-fragment02","212","Eysenck then argues that extroversion is the M_inherited basis of criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","213","Extroverts M_take longer to learn the M_rules of society , they are more likely to M_break M_them , and thus more likely become convicted criminals ."
"b17-fragment02","214","As M_with Lombroso 's work and the Gluecks ' study discussed M_above , by starting M_with institutionalised criminals , it is M_assumed that all prisoners are criminals and that most criminals do , M_in fact , go to prison ."
"b17-fragment02","215","The people who get caught and imprisoned may not be a representative M_picture of all criminals ."
"b17-fragment02","216","The major problem M_faced by theories M_suggesting a M_link M_between genetic M_make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing M_between genetic and environmental effects ."
"b17-fragment02","217","While some genetic influence can not be ruled out , just what is M_inherited remains very unclear ."
"b17-fragment02","218","Psychological theories"
"b17-fragment02","219","M_These theories M_share certain similarities M_with biological explanations ."
"b17-fragment02","220","They M_stress the M_link M_between criminal behaviour and specific personality traits or characteristics ."
"b17-fragment02","221","Psychological theories , however , M_see M_these characteristics as a result of unusual or abnormal experiences , rather than as M_inherited ."
"b17-fragment02","222","Thus , as M_with biological theories , crime is M_seen as pathological ( a disease ) , as something to be M_looked M_at M_from the medical M_point of M_view ."
"b17-fragment02","223","However , psychological causes are seen as treatable , whereas biological causes M_mark the individual for life ."
"b17-fragment02","224","M_In M_those cases there is no possible treatment , one is born a criminal ."
"b17-fragment02","225","Many psychological theories M_refer M_to faulty parent-child relationships , such as abnormal experiences M_in early childhood M_having a lasting effect and influence M_on personality ."
"b17-fragment02","226","Studies M_in M_this M_area have M_indicated that too M_strict or too M_lax parental M_attitudes increase the risk of delinquency ( the work of John Bowlby , for example ) ; they have M_found that if a young child is deprived of M_close personal relationships with parents or parent figures then ‘ problem behaviour ’ is more common ."
"b17-fragment02","227","It is well established that M_in the delinquent-prone , home discipline is more liable to be too M_lax , strict or erratic ."
"b17-fragment02","228","However , it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children , and M_this fact can hardly be used to M_explain present M_patterns of crime ."
"b17-fragment02","229","The majority of offenders do not come from M_disturbed or M_broken homes , and many M_broken homes do not M_produce delinquents ."
"b17-fragment02","230","Of course , M_this last M_point does not M_show that there is no M_link M_between parent-child relations and crime and delinquency ."
"b17-fragment02","231","The problem M_with M_assessing the influence of parental and family M_dimensions , such as M_weak supervision or parental criminality , is the fact that they are M_closely M_linked M_to various M_aspects of social and economic disadvantage , such as poverty , overcrowding and M_poor housing ."
"b17-fragment02","232","And it may be that M_these disadvantages help to cause parental difficulties , and M_hamper good parenting ."
"b17-fragment02","233","We can hardly do justice M_to the M_wide scope of psychological theories M_here , but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing ."
"b17-fragment02","234","M_These M_stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years , and M_conclude that anti-social , and by implication criminal , behaviour results M_from faulty personality development ."
"b17-fragment02","235","To summarise , M_these biological and psychological theories M_hold that the criminal is a particular type of person , apart from the M_rest of society and M_with a special predisposition M_toward criminal behaviour ."
"b17-fragment02","236","They are M_based M_on the idea that criminal behaviour is either M_inherited or a consequence of unique , individual experiences ."
"b17-fragment02","237","Before we M_look M_at sociological explanations it might be useful to ask yourself , or to discuss with colleagues , whether you M_feel that criminals are different ‘ types ’ of person ."
"b17-fragment02","238","While there are , no doubt , predispositions M_toward criminal behaviour , and clearly certain characteristics are M_inherited , most sociologists would reject M_these ‘ individual pathology ’ sort of theories ."
"b17-fragment02","239","They lack convincing M_supporting evidence ."
"b17-fragment02","240","While some offenders suffer M_from mental disorders the M_vast majority do not ."
"b17-fragment02","241","Furthermore , if criminals are abnormal then it M_follows that a M_large proportion of the population must also be abnormal ."
"b17-fragment02","242","For numerous studies have M_shown that a M_high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences , M_in particular M_high proportions of juveniles , and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal ."
"b17-fragment02","243","Sociological theories"
"b17-fragment02","244","We said M_above that sociologists would reject non-sociological explanations of crime ."
"b17-fragment02","245","M_This is not because such explanations are ‘ wrong ’ , but because they are M_incomplete or inadequate ."
"b17-fragment02","246","M_In Chapter One , it was M_stressed that crime can not be M_considered aside from its social M_context , that it is dependent M_on society defining certain actions as criminal , and M_on the M_reaction of others M_to such actions ."

"bmw-fragment09","2551","Perfectly M_groomed from head to toe and M_with all that assurance , she was ready to take on the M_world , Arlene thought M_with satisfaction , for she M_looked M_on Paula as her very own M_creation ."
"bmw-fragment09","2552","The M_raw M_materials might have been there M_before — indeed , had n't it been she , Arlene , who had M_spotted them ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2553","But the transformation of a leggy young M_filly M_into a sleekly beautiful M_racehorse had been her doing ."
"bmw-fragment09","2554","eighteen months M_on the M_model M_circuit had M_eliminated all M_trace of her former Somerset accent ."
"bmw-fragment09","2555","She had listened M_to Arlene 's own voice and set about M_imitating it for she M_held her mentor M_in the M_highest esteem whilst still being a little afraid of her ."
"bmw-fragment09","2556","The House of Mattli is M_expanding M_from couture M_into ready-to-wear and one of the M_big Bristol stores , Taylors , are M_putting M_on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prêt-è-porter ' , Arlene explained ."
"bmw-fragment09","2557","‘ I have been asked to M_supply the M_models and I would like you to be one of M_them . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2558","‘ Mattli ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2559","Paula repeated , impressed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2560","The House of Mattli was a husband and wife team who were numbered M_amongst the M_top ten names M_in the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers ."
"bmw-fragment09","2561","Furthermore Madame Mattli was a Frenchwoman , an accident of birth which added M_to her glamour , for was not Paris the fashion M_capital of the world ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2562","‘ Madame Mattli will be coming to Bristol herself , ’ Arlene continued ."
"bmw-fragment09","2563","‘ Taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from London especially for the show ."
"bmw-fragment09","2564","I only want the best of my girls M_on M_this job ."
"bmw-fragment09","2565","Madame Mattli , remember , is used M_to the best ."
"bmw-fragment09","2566","We ca n't M_afford any sloppiness ."
"bmw-fragment09","2567","I can count M_on you , Paula , I M_feel sure . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2568","‘ Oh yes , ’ Paula said , M_brimming M_with M_suppressed excitement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2569","‘ You can count M_on me ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2570","Madame Mattli was almost exactly as Paula had imagined she would be , a petite perfectly turned out woman M_with an M_air of chic that was unmistakably French ."
"bmw-fragment09","2571","Her M_dark , M_grey-streaked hair , which she wore M_in a long bob , had been cut by Vidal Sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit M_relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline ."
"bmw-fragment09","2572","In the fitting rooms at Taylors she fussed and fretted M_over her M_creations like a M_mother M_hen and though Paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her M_on sight ."
"bmw-fragment09","2573","Madame Mattli might be a stickler for detail , M_with a M_generous M_helping of the artistic temperament which kept her M_tight-coiled as a M_spring and which would M_explode M_into frenzy if the smallest detail was not as it should be , but she also had a M_kind face and M_deep M_perceptive eyes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2574","Half way M_through the day 's programme of shows , while the dressers went off to grab a sandwich and the model girls , who would not dare to eat while they were showing , M_revived themselves with cups of black coffee , Madame Mattli took Paula to one side ."
"bmw-fragment09","2575","‘ Little one , I would like to speak with you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2576","Paula 's stomach M_turned a M_somersault ."
"bmw-fragment09","2577","Had she done something wrong ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2578","‘ I have been watching you work , ’ Madame Mattli said M_directly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2579","Her accent reminded Paula of Louise — perhaps M_that was why she M_warmed M_to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring ."
"bmw-fragment09","2580","‘ You are exactly right for a couture M_model ."
"bmw-fragment09","2581","You have all the physical attributes . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2582","‘ Thank you , ’ Paula said faintly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2583","Madame Mattli waved a M_dismissive hand ."
"bmw-fragment09","2584","‘ Do not thank me ."
"bmw-fragment09","2585","I am not saying M_this to M_make your head M_swell ."
"bmw-fragment09","2586","M_On the contrary ."
"bmw-fragment09","2587","The fact is that I M_have a vacancy M_arising for a couture M_model ."
"bmw-fragment09","2588","I believe you are exactly what I am M_looking for ."
"bmw-fragment09","2589","I would like you to come to London to work for me . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2590","Over Madame Mattli 's shoulder Paula could see Arlene watching her , a tiny smile M_lifting one M_corner of her scarlet mouth , and Paula knew her well enough by now to know exactly what she was thinking ."
"bmw-fragment09","2591","She did not want to M_lose Paula , who was one of her best M_models , but already she was enjoying the M_reflected M_glory that M_came M_from having personally trained a house M_model for one of the great London couture houses ."
"bmw-fragment09","2592","She had known M_about the vacancy at Mattli and hoped that the job might be offered M_to Paula ."
"bmw-fragment09","2593","It was the M_seal of approval for her own judgement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2594","‘ Well ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2595","Madame Mattli demanded ."
"bmw-fragment09","2596","‘ Can I M_have a little time to think it over ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2597","Paula asked boldly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2598","‘ A little ."
"bmw-fragment09","2599","But please do not delay too long ."
"bmw-fragment09","2600","My M_present house M_model leaves M_at the M_end of the month and there are plenty of girls who would M_jump M_at the chance . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2601","‘ I 'm sure ."
"bmw-fragment09","2602","But all the same I could n't M_make such a M_move M_without M_giving it some thought , ’ Paula said grandly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2603","But inside she was M_bubbling M_with excitement ."
"bmw-fragment09","2604","Time to think ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2605","She did n't need a single second ."
"bmw-fragment09","2606","The moment Madame Mattli had offered her the job she had M_made M_up her mind ."
"bmw-fragment09","2607","She was going to M_take it — of course !"
"bmw-fragment09","2608","A month later Paula , smartly dressed in a new tweed suit with the obligatory matching bag and shoes , and lugging both her M_modelling case and a brand new cream leather suitcase , M_took the train to London to begin her new career ."
"bmw-fragment09","2609","She had booked herself a bed at a YWCA hostel for the time being ."
"bmw-fragment09","2610","It was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it M_had the advantage of being cheap and it M_went some M_way M_towards satisfying Grace , who was convinced that London was a M_den of iniquity M_waiting to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter ."
"bmw-fragment09","2611","From the hostel it was only a short tube ride to South Audley Street where Madame Mattli had her showrooms — yet another advantage , Paula thought , trying to weigh up the M_points in favour of the hostel , which she hated M_on sight ."
"bmw-fragment09","2612","Sharing a small spartan room with two other girls — Northerners whose accent Paula M_found almost incomprehensible and M_with whom she had nothing in common , making breakfast in the communal kitchen , queuing for the bath , M_adhering M_to a M_strict curfew M_after which time the doors were locked and bolted — none of M_these were restrictions Paula M_had the M_slightest intention of enduring for long ."
"bmw-fragment09","2613","But for now it would have to do ."
"bmw-fragment09","2614","And at least she was in London , M_centre of the British fashion M_industry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2615","As for the House of Mattli , it might have been M_in a different M_world M_to the hostel , M_with its M_air of being a M_cross M_between a M_workhouse and a M_boarding M_school ."
"bmw-fragment09","2616","The first time she rang the bell and went in through the front doors of the elegant old house where the showrooms were situated ( Mattli M_had no rear entrance ) Paula felt she was stepping M_into the place of her M_dreams ."
"bmw-fragment09","2617","M_Deep carpet covered the floors and the stairs M_swept up to the showrooms and the M_warren of workrooms beyond , and though the window drapes and furnishings were ever-so-slightly M_faded , as if they had M_seen better days , they were of the finest silks and velvets and every corner was swept , polished and cleaned daily so that no single speck of dust , let alone a cobweb , M_dared M_show itself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2618","The showroom was neither large nor small , decorated M_in muted M_shades of aubergine which would not detract M_from the clothes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2619","There was a low table and three or four dainty chairs with aubergine velvet seats and gilded spindle M_legs ."
"bmw-fragment09","2620","The crystal chandelier was for effect only — lighting that would show off the clothes M_to their best advantage was brilliant yet M_discreet , and along one wall were racks holding some of the ready-to-wear garments ."
"bmw-fragment09","2621","M_In contrast M_to M_this elegant frontage the workrooms beyond were a M_hive of frenzied activity ."
"bmw-fragment09","2622","Pattern cutters , fitters , sewing hands and their assistants all worked M_at an incredible speed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2623","M_This , Paula soon M_discovered , was the M_way of the fashion M_world — a M_constant frantic rush M_against the clock , to have collections M_ready M_on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their M_order more urgent , more important , than M_that of anyone else ."
"bmw-fragment09","2624","Paula was amazed by the security arrangements that were necessary to ensure that the new season 's collections remained exclusive — the windows at the rear of the premises were heavily barred and practically the first M_thing she had to do M_on commencing her M_employment was to sign a contract promising that she would not M_breathe a word M_about the designs she saw ."
"bmw-fragment09","2625","M_On her second day Madame Mattli took her to Vidal Sassoon 's salon in Grosvenor House so that her hair could be cut M_in an up-to-the-minute style ."
"bmw-fragment09","2626","Unlike some couturiers Madame did not mind if her M_model girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist M_on identical styles ."
"bmw-fragment09","2627","M_By the time Vidal Sassoon had finished M_with her Paula 's long M_fair locks had been shorn M_to a M_sharp geometric shape and she scarcely recognised the reflection that M_looked M_back at her from the mirror ."
"bmw-fragment09","2628","Among the rich and famous who had come to the salon to M_have their hair cut , tinted and set , Paula recognised Dusty Springfield , the pop singer , her eyes big and M_sooty , her lips pearly pink , and was unable to M_suppress the thrill of excitement which M_ran M_through her ."
"bmw-fragment09","2629","M_This was her very first M_taste of only the best being good enough — and she liked it !"
"bmw-fragment09","2630","It was Paula 's job to show samples , parading slowly M_up and M_down in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs M_taking M_in every detail of the garments M_with a M_critical and M_practised eye ."
"bmw-fragment09","2631","Sometimes they came alone , sometimes with a man M_in M_tow — to M_foot the M_bill !"
"bmw-fragment09","2632","Paula guessed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2633","The appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a M_stir M_amongst the girls , who all longed to M_hook a wealthy husband — and if he M_had a title , like the Aly Khan , or was a film star like Omar Shariff , then so much the better !"
"bmw-fragment09","2634","Not everything that Paula had to do was quite so glamorous , however ."
"bmw-fragment09","2635","M_In the M_long hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to M_lend a M_hand M_with some of the unskilled tasks — M_running errands and making tea , unpicking a seam or a hem , even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper M_way to do it ."
"bmw-fragment09","2636","Paula was not very clever M_with her needle but she soon learned to be careful so as not to incur the wrath of the seamstress ."
"bmw-fragment09","2637","There were new tricks of M_modelling to be learned too — how to remove a coat , sliding It carefully off her shoulders M_with the sleeves hanging M_in perfect balance , never for one moment allowing the inside to be M_on view , for samples were often unlined ."
"bmw-fragment09","2638","M_This M_trick M_took hours of practice , M_up and M_down the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her as if she had M_taken M_leave of her M_senses ."
"bmw-fragment09","2639","Although she enjoyed her job Paula was lonely ."
"bmw-fragment09","2640","Even the most popular of girls soon discovered that M_in M_this highly competitive M_world where M_models vied M_with one another for the most glamorous jobs and the wealthiest and best-looking men there was far more bitchiness than in the provinces — and Paula was far from popular ."
"bmw-fragment09","2641","The other girls disliked her for her outstanding looks and her haughty M_ways and M_made no attempt to be friendly M_on anything but the most superficial M_level and the pattern cutters and sewing hands hurried home to their families and boyfriends the moment they finished their M_long day 's work ."
"bmw-fragment09","2642","Paula M_spent most of her M_free time alone , window shopping , visiting News Theatres , where she sometimes watched the programme of cartoons twice M_round , and drinking endless cups of Espresso coffee in cafés and coffee houses ."
"bmw-fragment09","2643","Her favourite was the coffee shop in Fenwicks in Bond Street for M_this was the haunt and the meeting place of all M_those from the M_world of fashion ."
"bmw-fragment09","2644","One lunchtime when she had been at the House of Mattli for a few months Paula went there for her usual coffee and the cottage cheese salad that was her staple diet now that it was so important that she did not add a single half-inch to her M_wand-slim figure ."
"bmw-fragment09","2645","She took her tray to the pay desk , opened her bag and felt for her purse ."
"bmw-fragment09","2646","It was not there ."
"bmw-fragment09","2647","Frantically she M_rooted round , then checked her pockets M_without success ."
"bmw-fragment09","2648","‘ I 'm sorry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2649","I seem to have lost my purse … ’ she explained ."
"bmw-fragment09","2650","The girl behind the till stared at her stonily ."
"bmw-fragment09","2651","Paula was going hot and cold by now ."
"bmw-fragment09","2652","Had it been stolen ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2653","No , she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at Mattli — it must have fallen out then ."
"bmw-fragment09","2654","But without it she could not pay for her coffee and salad ."
"bmw-fragment09","2655","‘ M_Having trouble ? ’ a voice beside her M_asked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2656","‘ Do n't M_worry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2657","Let me . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2658","Paula turned gratefully , then gasped M_with surprise as she recognised the slight figure in black roll-neck sweater and skin tight pants ."
"bmw-fragment09","2659","‘ I do n't believe it !"
"bmw-fragment09","2660","Gary Oliver !"
"bmw-fragment09","2661","What are you doing here ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2662","‘ The same as you I expect , Paula — M_getting my strength M_up to M_face the rest of the day ."
"bmw-fragment09","2663","Let me pay and then we 'll have lunch together and do some M_catching M_up — unless you 're meeting someone , of course . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2664","‘ No — no , I 'm not . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2665","Paula picked up her try and moved aside waiting for him , flushed M_with pleasure M_at seeing a familiar face ."
"bmw-fragment09","2666","Gary Oliver was a designer , young and very talented ."
"bmw-fragment09","2667","She had met him M_back M_home in the west country when he had come to supervise a show M_put M_on by one of the M_big ready-to-wear labels , Carnega , for whom he worked as a M_junior M_member of the M_design team ."
"bmw-fragment09","2668","For a M_whole week they had worked M_closely together , sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and Paula had M_grown to like the M_pixieish little man who by his very M_nature M_offered her no M_challenge — and no M_threat ."
"bmw-fragment09","2669","Gary should have been a girl , she had thought , for he was half a head smaller than she was with M_fair curling hair , baby-blue eyes and long thick lashes that were the envy of every woman who met him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2670","‘ Shall we sit over there in the corner ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2671","Gary suggested ."
"bmw-fragment09","2672","He led the way , his slim hips in the tight fitting pants snaking gracefully between the tables ."
"bmw-fragment09","2673","They M_unloaded their trays on to a table ."
"bmw-fragment09","2674","‘ What are you doing in London then , Paula ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2675","Apart from mislaying your purse , I mean . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2676","He grinned M_at her impishly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2677","She told him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2678","‘ And what M_about you ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2679","Are n't you M_with Carnega any more ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2680","He shook his head ."
"bmw-fragment09","2681","Dimples M_played in his cheeks ."
"bmw-fragment09","2682","‘ No — now I 'm M_with the House of Oliver . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2683","‘ The House of Oliver … ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2684","Oh ! ’ she squealed as M_light M_dawned ."
"bmw-fragment09","2685","‘ Your own house ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2686","You 've M_set M_up as a designer M_in your own M_right , Gary ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2687","‘ Yep ."
"bmw-fragment09","2688","M_In a M_small M_way M_at the moment , of course , but M_things are happening ."
"bmw-fragment09","2689","I M_came M_into a M_bit of money when my grandmother died and I decided to M_put it M_to good use . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2690","‘ Is n't it a M_bit of a risk ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2691","Paula asked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2692","He shrugged his narrow shoulders ."
"bmw-fragment09","2693","‘ Perhaps ."
"bmw-fragment09","2694","But I wanted to work for myself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2695","Designing clothes for Carnega was all very well and I M_made a good living M_at it I wo n't deny but I wanted to be free to do my own M_thing — and to M_have my own name on the labels ."
"bmw-fragment09","2696","I M_have quite a few M_contacts — people who knew me when I was designing for Carnega — and they have been very encouraging ."
"bmw-fragment09","2697","So I have decided to move to London and M_open a showroom ."
"bmw-fragment09","2698","M_In fact I have just been looking M_at a place in South Audley Street , not far from Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2699","If it works out we shall M_practically be neighbours , Paula . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2700","‘ What a small world !"
"bmw-fragment09","2701","I M_had no idea , ’ Paula said , surprised she had not already heard the news ."
"bmw-fragment09","2702","Usually the M_slightest whisper M_travelled like M_jungle M_drums M_through the M_world of fashion ."
"bmw-fragment09","2703","M_Until now Gary had been an out-of-town designer , of course ."
"bmw-fragment09","2704","But if he was M_moving to London his new fashion house would soon be a talking point ."
"bmw-fragment09","2705","‘ We must M_keep M_in M_touch , ’ Gary said as he finished his cheese roll ."
"bmw-fragment09","2706","‘ Promise you 'll look in and say hello when you M_have time . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2707","‘ I will ."
"bmw-fragment09","2708","Apart from anything else I M_owe you a coffee . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2709","‘ True ."
"bmw-fragment09","2710","I do n't suppose I could persuade you to work for me M_in M_return ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2711","I 'm M_looking for a couple of good M_models ."
"bmw-fragment09","2712","Though I do n't suppose I could afford to pay you as well as Mattli does — yet ."
"bmw-fragment09","2713","Maybe one day … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2714","Paula laughed ."
"bmw-fragment09","2715","‘ I do n't earn M_that much !"
"bmw-fragment09","2716","M_By the time I 've paid for my room at the YWCA and bought all the make-up and clothes I need there never seems to be anything left M_over ."
"bmw-fragment09","2717","I 'm M_looking for a rich husband to M_take me M_away M_from it all . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2718","‘ And I 'm sure one day you 'll find him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2719","M_In the meantime , do n't forget your friends , eh Paula ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2720","‘ I wo n't , ’ she promised , glancing M_at her watch ."
"bmw-fragment09","2721","‘ Oh M_hell , I shall have to go . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2722","‘ Me too ."
"bmw-fragment09","2723","But it was M_great to see you again , Paula . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2724","They walked M_back to South Audley Street together , M_weaving their way through the lunchtime crowds on the pavements , the tall , striking girl and the young man whose M_pixieish M_looks belied his twenty-six years ."
"bmw-fragment09","2725","Outside the front entrance of the House of Mattli Paula turned to M_give him a M_quick impulsive hug ."
"bmw-fragment09","2726","‘ Thanks for the lunch , Gary ."
"bmw-fragment09","2727","And good luck M_with your new venture ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2728","She held up her fingers , M_tightly crossed for him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2729","He grinned ."
"bmw-fragment09","2730","‘ I 'll need it ."
"bmw-fragment09","2731","Do n't forget to come and see me , will you ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2732","I shall be expecting you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2733","‘ I wo n't forget ."
"bmw-fragment09","2734","'Bye for now ! ’ she called , and ran in through the imposing front door ."
"bmw-fragment09","2735","Madame Mattli was furious ."
"bmw-fragment09","2736","M_In all the time she had been M_with her Paula had never seen her so angry ."
"bmw-fragment09","2737","‘ I hear you have been seen going into the House of Oliver , ’ she said , her M_immaculately M_painted lips M_tight M_with fury ."
"bmw-fragment09","2738","Beside her Monsieur Mattli , a small Greek-looking man , some ten years her senior , was also quivering M_with indignation ."
"bmw-fragment09","2739","‘ Not once but several times , ’ he M_added ."
"bmw-fragment09","2740","It was so unusual for him to M_contribute anything M_to the conversation that Paula glanced M_at him M_in surprise ."
"bmw-fragment09","2741","Though he was always M_in M_evidence it was invariably Madame who did all the talking , M_giving M_orders , fussing around clients , so that Paula was never quite certain what his M_role was ."
"bmw-fragment09","2742","‘ Gary Oliver is a friend , ’ she said M_defensively ."
"bmw-fragment09","2743","Madame Mattli snorted angrily ."
"bmw-fragment09","2744","‘ I do not pay you to M_have friends M_in rival fashion houses . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2745","‘ He 's not a rival … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2746","Paula M_broke M_off ."
"bmw-fragment09","2747","It seemed ridiculous that a newcomer like Gary could be any M_threat M_to a well-established house like Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2748","But M_in the cut-throat M_world of fashion up and coming designers were to be feared — and already Gary 's reputation was M_growing ."
"bmw-fragment09","2749","‘ You know that we insist M_on M_complete loyalty , ’ Madame Mattli continued ."
"bmw-fragment09","2750","‘ The security of our M_designs is paramount ."
"bmw-fragment09","2751","Oh Paula , how could you ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2752","‘ But I would never mention anything I have seen here ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2753","Paula protested ."
"bmw-fragment09","2754","Madame snorted again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2755","‘ How can I be sure of M_that ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2756","Even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless ."
"bmw-fragment09","2757","Pillow talk is the most dangerous . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2758","‘ Pillow talk ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2759","Paula repeated , M_stunned ."
"bmw-fragment09","2760","M_Close though her friendship M_with Gary had become she had never once M_breathed a word M_to him M_about the new collections she saw M_taking M_shape at Mattli — and as for ‘ pillow talk ’ the notion was absurd ."
"bmw-fragment09","2761","There was nothing like M_that M_between them and never would be ."
"bmw-fragment09","2762","Gary was not interested M_in girls ."
"bmw-fragment09","2763","Surely M_that must be obvious M_to everyone who met him ."
"bmw-fragment09","2764","‘ You must stop visiting him , ’ Madame said M_firmly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2765","‘ Either I M_have your M_word M_on It or I am afraid you can no longer remain M_in my employ ."
"bmw-fragment09","2766","I want you to promise me here and now that you will not see Gary Oliver again . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2767","Paula was trembling ."
"bmw-fragment09","2768","Her job M_with the House of Mattli was her M_life ."
"bmw-fragment09","2769","But to allow herself to be M_dictated M_to M_in M_this M_way when she knew she had done nothing wrong was tantamount M_to M_admitting guilt ."
"bmw-fragment09","2770","And she could n't M_bear the thought of being M_sucked M_back M_into the M_ebb M_tide of loneliness again either ."
"bmw-fragment09","2771","M_With Gary she M_enjoyed a relationship she had never experienced M_with anyone else — the easy-going friendship of a male who M_made no demands whatever M_on her — and it M_meant more M_to her than she had realised ."
"bmw-fragment09","2772","‘ I have never M_betrayed any confidence and I never will ."
"bmw-fragment09","2773","But you ca n't expect me to M_cut myself M_off M_from my friends , ’ she said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2774","‘ I am afraid I do expect it , Paula , M_in M_this case . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2775","‘ I ca n't promise not to see Gary again . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2776","‘ Very well . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2777","There was a M_hint of sadness now in Madame 's eyes but her mouth was M_set and M_determined ."
"bmw-fragment09","2778","‘ I shall be sorry to M_lose you , Paula ."
"bmw-fragment09","2779","You are a good M_model and you M_suited me very well ."
"bmw-fragment09","2780","But you M_leave me no choice ."
"bmw-fragment09","2781","Please do not bother to come in again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2782","I shall contact the agency for a replacement M_immediately ."
"bmw-fragment09","2783","And I warn you , if any of my M_designs or anything like them M_turn M_up in the showroom at the House of Oliver I shall sue — and win the sort of M_damages that will M_put your little friend M_out M_of business for good ."
"bmw-fragment09","2784","Do I M_make myself M_clear ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2785","Paula was still afraid of Madame Mattli — and she was also M_close M_to tears ."
"bmw-fragment09","2786","But she was determined Madame should not be aware of either ."
"bmw-fragment09","2787","‘ Yes , Madame ."
"bmw-fragment09","2788","I 'm sorry to M_leave you , but I assure you you need not M_worry M_on M_that M_score . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2789","The showrooms of the House of Oliver were smaller and less grand than M_those at the House of Mattli but the décor was newer and M_fresher , M_pale grey drapes , ultra modern black furniture and a great M_deal of gleaming stainless steel ."
"bmw-fragment09","2790","Gary was in the workroom when Paula arrived , pinning a length of M_vibrant pink chiffon sarong-style around one of his M_models ."
"bmw-fragment09","2791","His mouth was full of pins ."
"bmw-fragment09","2792","‘ What are you doing here ? ’ he asked M_without moving his lips ."
"bmw-fragment09","2793","Paula M_perched herself against the cutting table M_trying to look nonchalant ."
"bmw-fragment09","2794","‘ I 've M_left Mattli , ’ she said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2795","Gary stared M_at her for a moment , pins M_spewing from his mouth and M_catching on the front of his black jersey ."
"bmw-fragment09","2796","Then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor ."
"bmw-fragment09","2797","The M_model stood motionless , clad in nothing but her bra and stockings , waiting for his instructions ."
"bmw-fragment09","2798","‘ We 'll M_leave M_this for now , Claudia ’ , he said ."
"bmw-fragment09","2799","‘ M_See if you can rustle up a cup of tea for Paula and me , please . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2800","The girl pulled on her wrap and moved to the door looking back over her shoulder as she went and Paula was aware of the hostility M_in her gaze ."
"bmw-fragment09","2801","Why was it all women hated her so , even when they did n't know her ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2802","She shrugged ."
"bmw-fragment09","2803","Oh well , she should be used M_to it by now …"
"bmw-fragment09","2804","Gary got up , took Paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa ."
"bmw-fragment09","2805","‘ What 's all M_this M_about , lovey ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2806","You ca n't have M_left Mattli . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2807","‘ I have . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2808","Paula M_related what had happened and saw Gary turn pale ."
"bmw-fragment09","2809","‘ Oh Lord !"
"bmw-fragment09","2810","You mean she thinks you 've been spying for me !"
"bmw-fragment09","2811","If she sues I 'll be M_ruined ."
"bmw-fragment09","2812","Even worse , someone of her M_stature could M_make a M_hell of a lot of trouble for me , even if she does n't . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2813","‘ But Gary — I have n't been spying for you !"
"bmw-fragment09","2814","I have n't even mentioned a single detail of the Mattli collection . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2815","‘ You know M_that and so do I. But suppose I 've done something similar ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2816","It happens every season — by M_sheer chance and M_law of averages some of the ideas are M_bound to M_come M_up ."
"bmw-fragment09","2817","There are always accusations of M_piracy and copy-catting , though they ca n't usually be substantiated ."
"bmw-fragment09","2818","But if she can prove that you and I … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2819","‘ M_That 's nonsense !"
"bmw-fragment09","2820","We have n't done anything wrong . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2821","Gary M_ran a M_distracted hand through his M_mop of M_fair hair ."
"bmw-fragment09","2822","‘ You 're going to have to describe the Mattli collection M_to me ."
"bmw-fragment09","2823","Every detail . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2824","‘ Gary ! ’ she objected , M_shocked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2825","‘ You 're an M_original ."
"bmw-fragment09","2826","You ca n't M_steal their ideas ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2827","‘ No , idiot — not so that I can M_steal them ."
"bmw-fragment09","2828","So that I can M_go M_through my M_designs and M_make quite certain that there is not one collar , not one cuff detail , not the M_slightest influence that they could accuse me of M_copying M_from them ."
"bmw-fragment09","2829","Oh Jesus Christ ! — suppose there 's something major ?"
"bmw-fragment09","2830","My peg top evening gown — my beautiful cerise lace — I could end up having to rethink the M_whole collection ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2831","‘ For goodness sake stop panicking ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2832","Paula said , though she could feel the M_seeds of panic herself ."
"bmw-fragment09","2833","‘ I 'm sure there 's nothing to M_worry M_about . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2834","‘ I only hope you 're right ! ’ he said M_in M_anguished tones ."
"bmw-fragment09","2835","The M_model came in with the cups of tea , still glowering M_darkly M_at Paula M_from beneath her fringe of M_false eyelashes ."
"bmw-fragment09","2836","It was M_clear she was blaming Paula bitterly for the M_interrupted afternoon and her boss 's drastic change of mood ."
"bmw-fragment09","2837","‘ That girl is a M_dog ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2838","Paula said when they were alone again ."
"bmw-fragment09","2839","‘ I 'm sure she ca n't do M_justice M_to your M_designs ."
"bmw-fragment09","2840","And M_with a M_miserable face like hers I 'm surprised you ever M_get any work done at all . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2841","Gary looked crestfallen ."
"bmw-fragment09","2842","‘ She 's the best I could get … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2843","‘ Oh what M_rubbish ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2844","Paula said roundly ."
"bmw-fragment09","2845","‘ Anyway , you 've got me now so you can M_get M_rid of her . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2846","‘ What do you mean ? ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2847","Gary asked ."
"bmw-fragment09","2848","He looked like a worried small boy ."
"bmw-fragment09","2849","‘ I told you — I 've M_left Mattli ."
"bmw-fragment09","2850","I 'll come and work for you . ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2851","‘ Oh Paula ! ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2852","Gary 's M_expression became even more anxious ."
"bmw-fragment09","2853","‘ You know I 'd give my right arm to M_have someone as good as you to M_model for me !"
"bmw-fragment09","2854","But I told you M_before — I could n't afford to pay you what you 're worth ."
"bmw-fragment09","2855","Well , not for ages , anyway ."
"bmw-fragment09","2856","It 's going to be a M_long M_struggle getting established and M_until I am I do n't M_see how … ’"
"bmw-fragment09","2857","Paula smiled ."
"bmw-fragment09","2858","For the first time she felt the M_stirrings of something like M_power ."
"bmw-fragment09","2859","It was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked M_at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be M_that for there was nothing sexual M_between her and Gary and never would be ."
"bmw-fragment09","2860","But it was just as exciting , nevertheless ."
"bmw-fragment09","2861","It M_made her feel M_strong , invincible almost , and just a tiny bit as if she had M_drunk too much M_wine ."
"bmw-fragment09","2862","Her smile M_spread ."
"ccw-fragment04","1991","We M_beat southwards all M_that first day , M_slicing through a glittering sea , and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind ."
"ccw-fragment04","1992","We hardly saw the Crowninshield twins ."
"ccw-fragment04","1993","They briefly appeared on deck for lunch ; a meal which Rickie hardly touched , while Robin-Anne , despite her apparent frailty , M_attacked the sandwiches and salad with the M_savagery of a M_starving M_bear ."
"ccw-fragment04","1994","Afterwards , incongruously dressed in a raincoat , she went to the M_bows and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it M_split and foamed at Wavebreaker 's cutwater ."
"ccw-fragment04","1995","She did not stay there long , but M_retreated from the M_fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with Ellen ."
"ccw-fragment04","1996","The contrast M_between the two American girls was almost M_painful ; Ellen was so healthy and strong , while the waif-like Robin-Anne was pathetically wan and listless ."
"ccw-fragment04","1997","‘ What do you think of her ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","1998","I asked Ellen M_that afternoon ."
"ccw-fragment04","1999","Ellen M_gave me an M_amused glance ."
"ccw-fragment04","2000","‘ M_Little Orphan Annie ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2001","It 's M_hard to believe she 's M_about to be M_worth six million dollars ."
"ccw-fragment04","2002","Still , she 's got precious little else M_going for her . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2003","I smiled M_at the severity of Ellen 's judgment ."
"ccw-fragment04","2004","‘ Is she M_that bad ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2005","‘ She has a distressingly simple mind , M_with only M_room for a single idea M_at any one time ."
"ccw-fragment04","2006","Presently M_that idea is cocaine , and nothing but cocaine ."
"ccw-fragment04","2007","She M_has an obsession M_with the drug that M_verges M_on monomania ."
"ccw-fragment04","2008","She tells me she needs to understand it if she 's going to M_defeat it . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2009","‘ Do n't you approve of M_that ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2010","‘ I think she 'd do better to understand herself , ’ Ellen said M_tartly ."
"ccw-fragment04","2011","‘ She allowed a man to persuade her M_into taking the drug , so she can only blame herself for her predicament ."
"ccw-fragment04","2012","She 'd M_find it more useful to understand her own character short­comings than to M_take an elementary M_course M_in drug chemistry . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2013","‘ What do you M_make of Rickie ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2014","I asked ."
"ccw-fragment04","2015","‘ He 's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out Phys Ed basketball-playing retard , ’ Ellen said scornfully , ‘ by which I mean that he 's a jock with the brains of a M_dung M_beetle ."
"ccw-fragment04","2016","He reminds me of your M_Neanderthal friend , the M_Maggot , except Rickie is a great deal more handsome . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2017","‘ Is he ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2018","She laughed M_at the suspicion of jealousy M_in my voice ."
"ccw-fragment04","2019","‘ Yes , Nicholas , he is ."
"ccw-fragment04","2020","But he 's not cute . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2021","M_At supper , as M_at lunch , Robin-Anne ate with the appetite of a M_horse , though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad ."
"ccw-fragment04","2022","‘ Do n't you like pasta ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2023","Ellen , who was perversely proud of her skills M_in the salad M_department , asked Rickie M_with just a M_touch of asperity ."
"ccw-fragment04","2024","‘ It 's M_great ."
"ccw-fragment04","2025","Really awesome . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2026","Rickie lit a cigarette ."
"ccw-fragment04","2027","‘ I just guess I 'm not hungry . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2028","Robin-Anne reached over and tipped her brother 's food on to her own plate ."
"ccw-fragment04","2029","‘ Kind of M_starving , ’ she justified her M_theft , then poured herself some diet soda ."
"ccw-fragment04","2030","For once we were carrying neither wine nor M_spirits on Wavebreaker , for Jackson Chatterton 's drug clinic had utterly M_forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol , saying that any mood-altering drug could M_hamper the M_success of a detoxification programme ."
"ccw-fragment04","2031","We were thus officially a M_dry boat , though I had hidden some Irish whiskey in the engine room , and I was sure that Ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka ."
"ccw-fragment04","2032","It seemed that Ellen and I were not the only ones to M_take such a precaution , for late M_that night Jackson Chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand ."
"ccw-fragment04","2033","‘ Bourbon , ’ he explained laconically ."
"ccw-fragment04","2034","‘ Want some ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2035","‘ I thought you 'd never ask . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2036","He chuckled , M_produced two cardboard cups , and poured me a M_generous M_slug of the whiskey ."
"ccw-fragment04","2037","We were alone on deck , though not the only ones awake for I could hear Rickie and Ellen 's voices M_coming from the open skylight of the main saloon ."
"ccw-fragment04","2038","I hoped Thessy was fast asleep for he would be M_taking the morning watch ."
"ccw-fragment04","2039","‘ Cheers , ’ I said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2040","Chatterton raised his cardboard cup M_in silent acknowledgement , then stared ahead to where a great M_beam M_swept around the sky ."
"ccw-fragment04","2041","‘ A lighthouse ? ’ he asked M_in a voice which M_suggested that a prudent man avoided such things ."
"ccw-fragment04","2042","I nodded ."
"ccw-fragment04","2043","‘ It 's called the Hole in the Wall ."
"ccw-fragment04","2044","Once we 're past it we can turn out to the open ocean ."
"ccw-fragment04","2045","M_Things will be a bit livelier then . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2046","‘ Livelier ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2047","‘ We 'll have a bit more sea , kick up some spray . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2048","I had spoken enthusiastically , but Jackson Chatterton seemed unmoved by the M_prospect ."
"ccw-fragment04","2049","‘ What are your M_plans ? ’ he asked me ."
"ccw-fragment04","2050","I M_had nothing particular M_planned , merely an idea that it might be interesting to M_thrash our way out into the M_open ocean , though , mindful of the danger of tropical storms , I M_had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole ."
"ccw-fragment04","2051","But I fancied feeling the M_long M_hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and , though we were short-handed , I M_reckoned that a few days M_out of sight of land would M_shake us all M_down quickly ."
"ccw-fragment04","2052","I explained all M_that M_to Chatterton , but M_stressed that we would M_run for M_cover M_at the first M_sign of trouble ."
"ccw-fragment04","2053","He must have M_assumed that I meant trouble M_from the twins , for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious ."
"ccw-fragment04","2054","‘ They wo n't M_give you any M_grief M_in the M_next few days , ’ he said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2055","‘ Now that they ca n't M_get M_hold of cocaine they 'll just crash out . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2056","I grimaced ."
"ccw-fragment04","2057","‘ Does M_that M_mean they 'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2058","Chatterton poured himself more bourbon , then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf ."
"ccw-fragment04","2059","‘ M_Coming M_off cocaine is n't like M_that ."
"ccw-fragment04","2060","At first they 'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep ."
"ccw-fragment04","2061","It 's the opposite of a cocaine M_high , you M_see . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2062","He paused ."
"ccw-fragment04","2063","‘ The difficult M_bit starts two or three days later ."
"ccw-fragment04","2064","M_That 's when the real M_hell begins . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2065","‘ For all of us ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2066","‘ It wo n't be easy , ‘ he said grimly , and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard ."
"ccw-fragment04","2067","The big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect M_from the twins , and for M_that I was grateful ."
"ccw-fragment04","2068","‘ I noticed that Rickie was n't eating today , ’ I said , ‘ but Robin-Anne was ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2069","Chatterton nodded ."
"ccw-fragment04","2070","‘ Rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago , which M_means he 's probably already M_over the M_crash period ."
"ccw-fragment04","2071","I promise you one M_thing ; he 's brought none of it on board ."
"ccw-fragment04","2072","I searched him and his luggage , and he was M_clean . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2073","The big man thought for a few seconds , then laughed ."
"ccw-fragment04","2074","‘ He 'd better be M_clean !"
"ccw-fragment04","2075","M_That M_turkey has M_got one chance of avoiding jail , just one , and M_that chance is by proving M_to the judge that he 's M_cleaned M_up his M_act ."
"ccw-fragment04","2076","And if he does n't do M_that , then the man will send Rickie 's plump young ass M_down to the gang-rape M_squad in the county jail . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2077","Chatterton did not sound unduly worried M_at M_that M_prospect ."
"ccw-fragment04","2078","‘ Can we be sure Robin-Anne did n't bring any of the drug aboard ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2079","I asked ."
"ccw-fragment04","2080","‘ She wo n't have done M_that , ’ Chatterton said M_with M_conviction ."
"ccw-fragment04","2081","‘ M_That girl is serious M_about giving it up , real serious , M_heavy serious !"
"ccw-fragment04","2082","M_That girl is really trying !"
"ccw-fragment04","2083","She studies the drug , you know ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2084","Like it was her M_enemy . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2085","Chatterton had spoken M_with genuine admiration ."
"ccw-fragment04","2086","I glanced up at the sails , down at the compass , then ahead to where the lighthouse M_loom arced powerfully M_through the night ."
"ccw-fragment04","2087","‘ So what are the twins , chances ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2088","‘ Depends M_on their will power , 'cause nothing else will M_do it for them ."
"ccw-fragment04","2089","There ai n't no pill to M_get you M_off the powder , Mr Breakspear , only will power ."
"ccw-fragment04","2090","And let me tell you , M_coming M_off coke is the M_hardest damn M_thing in the world , and you 're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to M_hold your M_hand while you M_go M_through the M_hell of it ."
"ccw-fragment04","2091","The twins ’ daddy has paid for you and me , Mr Breakspear , and for everyone else on board this boat , but even M_with all M_that money and all this boat , we still might not succeed M_with them . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2092","‘ It 's M_that M_hard ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2093","‘ It is M_that M_hard , ’ he said ominously , and I thought of John Maggovertski 's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder ."
"ccw-fragment04","2094","‘ And it 's even M_harder , ’ Jackson Chatterton 's voice was suddenly sinister , ‘ for a poor person who M_has no one to help them . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2095","I stared at Jackson Chatterton , and at last sensed the M_drama that M_lay M_behind his M_big M_calm presence ."
"ccw-fragment04","2096","‘ Why did you leave the army , Mr Chatterton ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2097","I asked M_after a M_long pause ."
"ccw-fragment04","2098","‘ I guess you can guess , ’ he said ."
"ccw-fragment04","2099","I guessed , but did not M_make him confirm my guess ."
"ccw-fragment04","2100","Instead I"
"ccw-fragment04","2101","asked whether the American army had M_helped him to M_kick his drug M_habit ."
"ccw-fragment04","2102","‘ Sure they tried , they tried real M_hard , but M_back then I did n't"
"ccw-fragment04","2103","want to be helped . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2104","‘ But you still M_got M_off cocaine ?"
"ccw-fragment04","2105","M_On your own ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2106","‘ Eventually . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2107","The light inside the binnacle M_glossed his black"
"ccw-fragment04","2108","face M_with a sheen of red , M_sparking his eyes like fire ."
"ccw-fragment04","2109","He was not looking at me , but staring doggedly ahead M_into the M_turning white light of the Hole in the Wall ."
"ccw-fragment04","2110","‘ And I had to M_lose a good , good woman before I M_came M_to my senses ."
"ccw-fragment04","2111","But I did M_kick the drug , Mr Breakspear , and it was probably the M_hardest damned M_thing I ever did M_in all my life ."
"ccw-fragment04","2112","But once I 'd done it , I swore I 'd help others do it . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2113","‘ Even the very rich ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2114","I asked provocatively ."
"ccw-fragment04","2115","‘ The rich M_trash pay the bills , Mr Breakspear , which M_lets me M_give my M_spare time M_away M_to the poor M_trash . ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2116","I looked at the M_tough , impressive face ."
"ccw-fragment04","2117","‘ Are the twins M_trash ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2118","He paused M_before replying , then M_gave the smallest shake of his head ."
"ccw-fragment04","2119","‘ She 's OK , but him ? ’"
"ccw-fragment04","2120","M_This time the pause was almost eloquent , then he M_gave a M_richly M_contagious laugh ."
"ccw-fragment04","2121","‘ I 'd have liked to have M_had Rickie Crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes . ’"

"clw-fragment01","2","A M_Model to M_Link Personality Characteristics M_to a Preference for Science"
"clw-fragment01","3","John Head"
"clw-fragment01","4","M_Introduction"
"clw-fragment01","5","M_In recent years there has been a M_steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors M_play a crucial M_role M_in determining M_subject choice and student success ."
"clw-fragment01","6","Unfortunately , M_this evidence has tended to be fragmentary , a M_collection of M_separate , discrete M_pieces of information lacking a M_synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive M_power ."
"clw-fragment01","7","The few M_models which have been developed M_to date may have been correct as M_far as they M_go but are clearly incomplete ."
"clw-fragment01","8","For example Roe ( 1952 ) , Eiduson ( 1962 ) and McClelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a M_lonely childhood , perhaps suffering social M_isolation M_through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a M_strong interest M_in their surrounding material M_world and a M_below average M_interest M_in other people and relationships ."
"clw-fragment01","9","Maslow ( 1966 ) and Hudson ( 1966 and 1968 ) M_saw science as providing an emotionally M_undemanding activity M_appealing M_to boys M_moving M_from the calm of latency M_to the M_turbulence of adolescence ."
"clw-fragment01","10","Even if M_these descriptions are valid they still M_leave M_open a number of M_questions , particularly why the same M_mechanisms do not M_operate M_with girls ."
"clw-fragment01","11","M_Arising M_from the evidence M_in the literature and M_from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a M_model which is compatible M_with all the evidence and which also M_has considerable predictive potential ."
"clw-fragment01","12","What we know M_about persons choosing science"
"clw-fragment01","13","The evidence for an M_association M_between personality characteristics and an M_interest M_in science has been more fully reviewed by Head ( 1979 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","14","We need now only M_take M_note of the most salient M_features ."
"clw-fragment01","15","The most obvious one is M_that of sex differences ."
"clw-fragment01","16","The predominance of males , particularly M_in the physical sciences and engineering , M_throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed M_to cognitive differences , which are too M_small , nor M_to institutional factors ."
"clw-fragment01","17","Equal opportunity M_in education and employment has not M_made science any more popular M_with women ."
"clw-fragment01","18","Furthermore , the characteristics of M_those students who do opt for science M_show M_clear sex differences ."
"clw-fragment01","19","Male scientists , both science students and M_mature , professional scientists , tend to be emotionally reticent , disliking overt emotional expression M_in others and themselves , and depending M_upon their partners M_in personal relationships to M_take the emotional initiatives ."
"clw-fragment01","20","They will also tend to be authoritarian , conservative and controlled M_in their thinking ."
"clw-fragment01","21","M_These differences can be M_seen quite early M_on ; we have M_found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers ."
"clw-fragment01","22","Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or M_rigid M_in their thinking , although they do seem to M_have M_low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive ."
"clw-fragment01","23","We also know that M_at M_about the age of 13 a very M_high M_proportion of boys are M_attracted M_to science and scientific careers ."
"clw-fragment01","24","Thereafter , there is a M_steady decline of M_interest M_in science and M_this disillusionment M_extends right M_through the secondary-school years and M_into the undergraduate period ."
"clw-fragment01","25","M_In M_contrast , only a minority of girls M_express an M_interest M_in science M_at any age but there is no obvious M_swing M_from science M_in the M_middle and late teens ."
"clw-fragment01","26","Some further evidence has M_come M_from our use of sentence completion tests M_with secondary-school M_pupils as M_part of our research programme at Chelsea ."
"clw-fragment01","27","Analysis of M_these M_responses provides further information M_on sex differences and M_between M_those opting for different M_subjects ."
"clw-fragment01","28","For example , girls M_at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to M_take a more M_mature M_attitude M_to personal relationships , M_seeing their complexity and reciprocal M_nature , while boys are more exploitative ."
"clw-fragment01","29","In relation to the sentence M_stem ‘ A girl and her mother … ’ , girls often M_produce M_responses like ‘ often M_go M_through a bad M_patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other , become the best of friends ’ or ‘ can help each other M_with their problems ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","30","Similar questions , when asked of boys , tend to M_produce banal responses or exploitative ones , for example the parent is M_seen as the M_source of money ."
"clw-fragment01","31","M_In M_contrast , boys seem to M_have a M_firmer self-identity and a M_clearer ambition M_showing more insight in response to sentence M_stems such as ‘ My main problem is … ’ and ‘ He/she M_felt proud that … ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","32","Such findings M_give us some clues M_about the characteristics of boys and girls of M_these ages ."
"clw-fragment01","33","If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science M_with other boys , we M_find that the former M_have very cut-and-dried M_views M_on many issues ."
"clw-fragment01","34","For example , they M_take the M_view that ‘ criminals should be severely punished ’ or that ‘ anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","35","M_To the sentence M_stem ‘ When a child will not M_join M_in group activities … ’ , M_these boys M_gave responses like ‘ he is selfish ’ , ‘ he must be stupid ’ , ‘ he deserves to be unpopular ’ ."
"clw-fragment01","36","M_In M_contrast , other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and M_ways of integrating the child M_into the group ."
"clw-fragment01","37","The science boys seemed to M_possess few doubts or uncertainties , they offered clear-cut answers ."
"clw-fragment01","38","It was M_this evidence which M_suggested the possible M_model for M_subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement ."
"clw-fragment01","39","Ego-identity M_in adolescence"
"clw-fragment01","40","M_This M_model was originally postulated by Erikson ( 1965 ) and then developed by Marcia ( 1966 and 1976 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","41","Erikson M_suggests that M_at different M_phases of life an individual M_faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved M_before M_moving M_on M_to the M_next M_phase ."
"clw-fragment01","42","For adolescents the M_acquisition of a M_clear ego-identity is the crucial task ."
"clw-fragment01","43","M_At the beginning of adolescence , the individual is a M_within the family and the school ."
"clw-fragment01","44","M_By the M_end of adolescence he or she needs to M_make choices M_about career , life-style , personal relationships and ideologies ."
"clw-fragment01","45","The ego-identity of M_that person is M_shaped by M_these choices ."
"clw-fragment01","46","Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue ."
"clw-fragment01","47","Some problems M_about identity M_arise M_with the young child M_in the M_context of home and school , and others occur M_in later life , for example M_on retirement ."
"clw-fragment01","48","Nevertheless , adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably M_dominates the personal development of the individual for a while ."
"clw-fragment01","49","The adolescent does not , however , need to achieve a M_clear ego-identity M_on all topics M_at one time ."
"clw-fragment01","50","He or she may M_have a M_clear identity M_in respect M_to his or her career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology ."
"clw-fragment01","51","M_In M_this article we are concerned M_with ego-identity achievement M_in respect M_to career ."
"clw-fragment01","52","Marcia has M_put more M_detail M_onto the Erikson M_model and suggests that M_in M_going M_from the initial M_ego-diffusion M_condition M_to M_that of having achieved ego-identity , two processes are involved : M_crisis and commitment ."
"clw-fragment01","53","M_Crisis M_in M_this M_context M_describes a period of intensive M_self-examination M_in which one 's beliefs and M_values are re-examined ."
"clw-fragment01","54","Commitment M_means that the individual M_has M_acquired M_clear and M_firm beliefs both M_about himself or herself and the world ."
"clw-fragment01","55","Figure 16.1 M_indicates a number of possible M_routes M_to ego-identity achievements ."
"clw-fragment01","56","A person may undergo M_crisis and commitment simultaneously and M_progress by M_route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and M_self-examination M_in which all one 's beliefs tend to be very M_fluid , a period known as moratorium , M_before M_acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved ( M_route B ) ."
"clw-fragment01","57","A further possibility is that the individual may , at least for a time , M_hold M_onto beliefs and M_values M_taken M_without question M_from others , for example parents , teachers , peers ."
"clw-fragment01","58","M_This M_condition is known as M_foreclosure ."
"clw-fragment01","59","Eventually M_these persons might have to face up to period of M_crisis , of M_self-examination , and so achieve ego-identity by M_route C. However , M_foreclosure does M_offer an M_escape M_route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real M_self-examination by M_clinging M_rigidly M_to his or her beliefs and M_values ( M_route D ) ."
"clw-fragment01","60","Ego-identity and Choosing Science"
"clw-fragment01","61","We can now M_make the M_link M_between M_this M_model of adolescent development and M_subject choice M_in schools ."
"clw-fragment01","62","For boys M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage , science is likely to be appealing ."
"clw-fragment01","63","The physical sciences in particular , M_offer a conventional career choice which is likely to M_win approval M_from parents , teachers and peers ."
"clw-fragment01","64","They will tend to M_regard the overt expression of emotions , including much such expression M_in the arts , as being M_soft and feminine ."
"clw-fragment01","65","Science , M_with its masculine M_image , M_makes little emotional M_demand M_on an individual and seems to M_offer M_clear , precise M_answers M_to problems ."
"clw-fragment01","66","Opting for science will M_permit and possibly M_reinforce emotional reticence ."
"clw-fragment01","67","For a girl M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage the M_situation is very different ."
"clw-fragment01","68","There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized M_into adult M_roles more M_through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than M_through their career ( Douvan and Adelson , 1966 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","69","Furthermore , M_these girls will tend to M_go M_into a career M_with a feminine M_image , one which already M_attracts many girls ."
"clw-fragment01","70","Consequently , very few girls M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage will M_enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a M_model to do so M_from their parents and their school ."
"clw-fragment01","71","Neither boys nor girls M_at the moratorium M_stage are likely to be M_attracted M_to the science that is usually M_presented M_in our schools ."
"clw-fragment01","72","They are M_at a M_stage when they are likely to be concerned M_with a variety of complex issues ; the meaning of life , the existence of God , ideologies , their emerging sexuality , their future career and life-style — too often science is M_seen as being purely instrumental M_with nothing to M_contribute M_to M_these debates ."
"clw-fragment01","73","Science , somehow , seems to be scarcely relevant M_to the most important issues M_in our life ."
"clw-fragment01","74","A M_proportion of both boys and girls M_at ego-identity achievement M_stage will M_choose science ."
"clw-fragment01","75","M_In fact , most girls M_entering science are probably M_at M_this M_stage as they will need some M_self-examination and sense of commitment to M_make M_this unconventional choice ."
"clw-fragment01","76","However , only a minority of adolescents will have M_reached the ego-identity achievement M_stage M_at the age when most M_pupils have to M_make crucial decisions M_about M_subject choice M_at school ."
"clw-fragment01","77","M_This M_model seems to M_explain our M_observations ."
"clw-fragment01","78","A M_large number of boys , particularly M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage , are initially M_attracted M_to science but there is a M_drift M_away M_throughout later adolescence as they undergo some M_crisis ."
"clw-fragment01","79","The preponderance of boys M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage will M_yield the M_rigid , authoritarian M_attitudes often associated M_with scientists ."
"clw-fragment01","80","The few girls who M_enter science will not usually show M_these M_foreclosure characteristics ."
"clw-fragment01","81","Effects of Curriculum M_Changes"
"clw-fragment01","82","The real use of M_this M_model M_linking personality development M_to M_subject choice is that it M_allows us to M_make predictions M_about how M_pupils might M_react M_to M_changes M_in school science curriculum and school organization ."
"clw-fragment01","83","We can M_consider three possible M_changes :"
"clw-fragment01","84","1"
"clw-fragment01","85","Delaying M_subject choice : Britain is unusual M_in asking M_pupils to M_make crucial choices M_about M_subject options M_in the 13–16 age M_range ."
"clw-fragment01","86","M_These decisions can only be M_reversed M_with M_great difficulty ."
"clw-fragment01","87","What effect would delaying the choice M_make ?"
"clw-fragment01","88","M_In the development M_through the years of adolescence the number of M_foreclosure M_pupils will diminish , hence the recruitment of boys M_into science would be M_cut ."
"clw-fragment01","89","More boys and girls will have M_reached the ego-identity achievement M_stage and a M_proportion of M_these will M_go M_into science ."
"clw-fragment01","90","Overall there would be a M_reduction M_in the number of students choosing science , but M_those who do so choose will be more likely to M_stay happily M_in the M_subject and to possess more M_flexible minds ."
"clw-fragment01","91","The quantitative loss would be M_met by a qualitative improvement ."
"clw-fragment01","92","2"
"clw-fragment01","93","M_Giving science a more feminine M_image : It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist M_in M_showing illustrations of boys , rather than girls , doing practical work in the laboratory , and so forth ."
"clw-fragment01","94","What effect would a deliberate attempt to M_change M_this M_image M_have ?"
"clw-fragment01","95","It might M_make it easier for girls M_at the M_foreclosure M_stage to accept science so recruitment might increase ."
"clw-fragment01","96","Some of M_these girls might , however , M_drift M_away again when they M_reach their M_crisis period ."
"clw-fragment01","97","Unless the M_change M_in M_image was immense , boys would probably not be affected , science would still be an obvious , acceptable choice for a boy ."
"clw-fragment01","98","Overall there would be some increase M_in the recruitment of girls , but no qualitative improvement ."
"clw-fragment01","99","3"
"clw-fragment01","100","M_Emphasizing the M_applications and relevance of science : To obtain a major qualitative improvement M_to recruitment M_in science M_with more girls and M_with students M_possessing imaginative , M_flexible minds it would be necessary to M_make science appealing M_to boys and girls M_at the moratorium M_stage ."
"clw-fragment01","101","M_In M_that event science must be M_seen to be relevant M_to the issues which concern them ."
"clw-fragment01","102","The probable implication is that science would need to be M_presented M_in the M_context of the needs of society and individuals ."
"clw-fragment01","103","Probably a case-study M_approach involving the M_application of science , and the M_interaction M_with other disciplines , would be needed ."
"clw-fragment01","104","Our knowledge M_about the girls ' concern M_with personal relationships M_suggests that the introduction of some M_elements of the social sciences M_into the case studies might prove M_attractive ."
"clw-fragment01","105","Is it possible to M_change school science M_in M_this M_fashion and still M_preserve the essential M_character of science itself ?"
"clw-fragment01","106","Clearly there would need to be some drastic M_pruning of content ."
"clw-fragment01","107","Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to M_cover their M_subjects so comprehensively ."
"clw-fragment01","108","A history teacher is content to M_cover the history of one country or continent M_over a few decades ."
"clw-fragment01","109","Perhaps we must M_make similar choices ."
"clw-fragment01","110","It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education ( 1979 ) policy statement in Britain and the proposals M_on school physics M_coming M_from the Institute for Science Education ( IPN ) in Kiel are M_advocating such M_changes ."
"clw-fragment01","111","The difference is that we are now offering a M_formal psychological M_model to suggest that if we want to M_reduce the current M_encapsulation of science , if we want to M_recruit a different sort of student , then certain curriculum M_changes are needed ."

"clw-fragment01","115","M_Over 90 per cent of M_entries M_in all technical M_subjects are M_from boys ."
"clw-fragment01","116","M_This M_means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a M_wide M_range of M_courses M_in further and M_higher education and for M_entry M_to M_occupations requiring a scientific or technical M_base ."
"clw-fragment01","117","Female exclusion M_from science and technology , even if it is apparently by girls ' own choice , also M_means that as citizens their ability to understand and M_control their environment is limited ."
"clw-fragment01","118","Nevertheless , most schools M_consider they are already providing equal opportunities by M_neutral treatment of the two sexes ( Bloomfield , 1984 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","119","M_In effect , ignoring the effects of gender M_in M_this M_way merely M_reinforces stereotyping because it M_does nothing to M_challenge the definition of certain M_aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine ."
"clw-fragment01","120","Girls Into Science and Technology ( GIST ) was the first major schools-based project M_addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school , and was an example of ‘ action research ’ M_in education ; the project simultaneously M_took action to improve girls ' achievement M_in science and technology and M_investigated the reasons for their under-achievement ."
"clw-fragment01","121","The project team M_collaborated M_with teachers M_in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the Greater Manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies M_designed to improve girls ' M_attitudes M_to the physical sciences and technical M_subjects ."
"clw-fragment01","122","Two other schools were involved as M_controls where M_attitude testing but no interventions M_took M_place . …"
"clw-fragment01","123","The M_approach was collaborative : teachers were invited to work M_with the team as equal partners M_in the attempts both to investigate and M_find solutions M_to the GIST problem ."
"clw-fragment01","124","However , very few of the teachers even M_recognized the issue as one of professional concern M_at the M_start of the project , and most of the first two years was M_spent M_in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working M_towards the development of feasible intervention strategies ."
"clw-fragment01","125","The project and its outcomes have been fully described M_elsewhere ( Smail et al . ,"
"clw-fragment01","126","1982 ; Kelly , Whyte and Smail , 1984 ; Whyte M_in press ) ."
"clw-fragment01","127","GIST M_had more success M_in altering children 's M_attitudes than their M_subject choices , suggesting that it is easier to M_change M_attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour ."
"clw-fragment01","128","M_Pupils M_in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than M_pupils in M_control schools ."
"clw-fragment01","129","They also M_had slightly more positive M_attitudes M_towards science and scientists and were less likely to M_define them as exclusively masculine ."
"clw-fragment01","130","Despite some evidence of M_change M_in teachers ' M_attitudes and behaviour , they themselves were reluctant to M_admit that the project had influenced them ."
"clw-fragment01","131","According to an evaluation report M_this may M_reflect an unwillingness to M_admit that M_in the past schools have been sex biased ( Payne , Cuff and Hustler , 1984 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","132","The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement M_in science and technology is at least partly socially M_constructed by the school , an hypothesis M_based M_on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis ( M_see , for example , Kelly , 1981 ) ."
"clw-fragment01","133","During the project there was a M_shift M_away M_from M_locating the issue as one of girls ' motivation M_towards attempts to M_change the M_nature of school science ."
"clw-fragment01","134","One of the main gains M_from the GIST project has been the clarification of what is M_meant by a ‘ girl friendly ’ , science , that is a science which will M_appeal equally M_to the M_interests and concerns of girls as well as boys . …"
"clw-fragment01","135","M_Making Science More Girl Friendly"
"clw-fragment01","136","Several interventions were M_designed to M_make science more girl friendly ."
"clw-fragment01","137","Schools and teachers M_tried curriculum development to M_build M_on girls ' science M_interests , M_changing M_patterns of classroom interaction , single sex groups and classes ."
"clw-fragment01","138","The M_largest M_scale intervention was the VISTA programme , which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk M_to children M_about an M_aspect of their jobs already being M_covered M_in the school science syllabus ."
"clw-fragment01","139","VISTA M_made science more girl friendly M_in two M_ways : both boys and girls were offered an M_attractive M_image of a competent woman scientist , and talks M_concentrated M_on social and industrial M_applications of science , an M_element too often missing M_from science M_at school ."
"clw-fragment01","140","One school was so impressed by the children 's positive M_reactions that they completely revamped the science work M_in the first two years to M_include more social and human M_applications of science ."
"clw-fragment01","141","The M_survey of children 's M_attitudes M_helped M_here : research such as Ormerod 's ( 1971 ; Ormerod and Duckworth , 1975 ) had M_shown that girls were interested M_in the social implications of science , but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching M_approach might be M_in practice ."
"clw-fragment01","142","Would science M_in the M_home be a M_starter ?"
"clw-fragment01","143","A question M_from our M_survey M_asked children whether they would like to know more M_about how a vacuum cleaner works ; hardly anyone did , and girls were even less curious than boys ."
"clw-fragment01","144","M_This M_told us that any simplistic assumptions M_about featuring ‘ female ’ domestic M_interests M_in science would probably M_meet M_with failure ."
"clw-fragment01","145","The rest of the questionnaire M_about science curiosity M_showed that all the children were enthusiastic M_about learning science , and that girls were M_keen to know more M_about nature , the environment and medical science ."
"clw-fragment01","146","M_Over 50 per cent , and M_in some cases M_over 60 per cent said they would like to learn M_about the human heart , germs and illnesses , how our muscles M_work , what food is good for you , life in the sea , what M_makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made ."
"clw-fragment01","147","It was helpful that M_these topics also interested boys ."
"clw-fragment01","148","At present the science curriculum is M_structured M_around physical science M_interests , M_on which boys are M_keener ( how motor cars M_work , atoms and molecules ) ; we were able to recommend that teaching M_build M_on the M_overlapping M_interests of the two sexes , because girls as well as boys want to know more M_about human biology and spectacular M_features of the environment ( animals in the jungle , volcanoes and earthquakes , acids and chemicals ) ."
"clw-fragment01","149","The less immediately M_attractive M_parts of science could be M_approached M_through M_these M_interests , for instance teaching ‘ forces ’ by beginning M_with the M_action of muscles in the human arm , and ‘ light ’ M_via the dissection of a bull 's eye ."

"clw-fragment01","152","Other GIST Interventions"
"clw-fragment01","153","All the GIST schools were mixed comprehensives , and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all , M_on the grounds that it M_ran counter M_to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy ."
"clw-fragment01","154","Then certain teachers were particularly M_struck by the evidence of M_large differences M_in the M_interests and experience children M_brought M_with them to school ."
"clw-fragment01","155","Girls M_had M_far less ‘ tinkering ’ experience than boys and the M_connection M_with their lesser M_interest M_in topics like ‘ how electricity is produced ’ seemed obvious ."
"clw-fragment01","156","Several special science or craft clubs were organized M_in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers M_planned single-sex teaching ."
"clw-fragment01","157","As we shall M_see , it was M_in M_these two schools that the M_largest measurable M_changes of M_attitude and option choice occurred ."
"clw-fragment01","158","For a more girl friendly science , it seems M_vital that teachers should M_come to M_see that when all the masculine M_packaging , evident M_in textbooks and M_resources as well as teachers ' and boys ' behaviour in the classroom , is M_removed , girls can be very enthusiastic M_about science . …"
"clw-fragment01","159","Alison Kelly M_sees at least four M_distinct senses M_in which it can be argued that science is masculine ."
"clw-fragment01","160","First , the M_pupils , teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers ; second , school science is M_packaged and M_presented to M_appeal M_to boys , not girls ; third , classroom behaviours and interaction M_operate to M_reconstruct science as a male activity , and finally it has been suggested that ‘ scientific ’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine M_world M_view ."
"clw-fragment01","161","The GIST interventions described M_above relate to three of M_these : VISTA women , albeit briefly and temporarily , redressed the numerical M_balance by offering female role models of practising scientists ; VISTA and the curriculum development which M_followed involved a limited ‘ M_repackaging ’ of science to M_remove its exclusively masculine M_appeal , and the single-sex classes and classroom observation M_showed how science M_comes to be M_defined as ‘ masculine ’ M_in the mixed school ."
"clw-fragment01","162","The fourth M_point , the idea that science is intrinsically masculine , can be M_sustained only by M_clinging M_to an irredeemably M_narrow conception of science and scientific thinking ."

"cty-fragment03","457","II THE FIRST CRITIQUE"
"cty-fragment03","458","Unity had been easy during the Resistance , because relationships were almost always man-to-man ."
"cty-fragment03","459","M_Over M_against the German army or the Vichy government , M_where social generality M_ruled , as it does M_in all M_machines of state , the Resistance M_offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal ."
"cty-fragment03","460","The psychological and moral M_elements of political action were almost the only ones to M_appear M_here , which is why intellectuals least M_inclined M_to politics were to be M_seen M_in the Resistance ."
"cty-fragment03","461","The Resistance was a unique experience for them , and they wanted to M_preserve its experience M_in the new French politics because M_this experience M_broke M_away M_from the famous dilemma of being and doing , which M_confronts all intellectuals M_in the M_face of action … ."
"cty-fragment03","462","It is only too obvious that M_this M_balance M_between action and personal life was M_intimately M_bound M_up M_with the conditions of clandestine action and could not M_survive it ."
"cty-fragment03","463","And M_in M_this M_sense it must be M_said that the Resistance experience , by M_making us believe that politics is a M_relationship M_between man and man or M_between consciousnesses , M_fostered our illusions of 1939 and M_masked the truth of the incredible M_power of history which the Occupation M_taught us M_in another M_connection ."
"cty-fragment03","464","If M_by 1945 Merleau-ponty had M_here already M_indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre 's project M_in the Critique , the theoretical problem that M_followed was how to M_unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity M_with the individualism of Sartre 's earlier work , M_that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom : how to M_relocate human practice M_within historical determinism , to M_reconcile the individual M_with the social , the idea of agency M_with M_that of necessity , or freedom M_with history ?"
"cty-fragment03","465","For Marxist or Hegelian thought , such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable M_through the operations of dialectical logic ."
"cty-fragment03","466","Citing Marx 's famous remark M_in The Eighteenth Brumaire , ‘ Men M_make their own History … but M_under circumstances … M_given and M_transmitted M_from the past ’ , Sartre suggested that M_this implied ‘ the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity , ( I , 35 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","467","Accordingly , he attempted to M_shift Marxism M_away M_from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism M_towards the primacy of a concept of ‘ History ’ which , while still a totality as it had been for Lukács , a process M_with a determinate meaning and M_end , could also M_include a concept of human agency and thus M_articulate the individual M_with the social , freedom M_with determinism ."
"cty-fragment03","468","Today , Sartre 's voluntarism is M_to some M_extent M_returning M_to favour as the result of a desire to M_retrieve the categories of agency and the M_subject , which M_goes M_together M_with the wish to M_get M_out M_of the apparently totalizing M_systems of Adorno , Althusser or Foucault ."
"cty-fragment03","469","Sartre 's M_stress M_on the M_role of the M_subject also M_finds approval because many of M_those no longer M_prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the M_progress of a single M_narrative of M_class-struggle , have begun to argue instead for a M_return of its correlative , the M_subject , almost as if it was the M_next best M_thing M_in the absence of history itself ."
"cty-fragment03","470","But it still M_leaves us M_with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve , namely how to M_link human consciousness M_with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the M_agent of the latter ."
"cty-fragment03","471","How could M_this M_take place ?"
"cty-fragment03","472","As Sartre had M_put it M_in What is Literature ? :"
"cty-fragment03","473","‘ Never has homo faber better understood that he has M_made history and never has he M_felt so powerless M_before history ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","474","How can man M_make history if M_at the same time it is history which M_makes him ?"
"cty-fragment03","475","Sartre M_considered that orthodox dialectical materialism M_takes the easy M_way M_out by merely M_eliminating the first in favour of the second , M_making man a M_passive M_product entirely determined by economic circumstances ."
"cty-fragment03","476","Unwilling to M_follow Merleau-Ponty by M_dropping the second in favour of the first , Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once M_through the M_movement of praxis , M_that is intentional actions which M_produce M_material effects ."
"cty-fragment03","477","Its corollary , whereby praxis becomes determining history , he called the ‘ M_practico-inert ’ , by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis ."
"cty-fragment03","478","The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized , M_deftly M_uniting freedom M_with necessity ."
"cty-fragment03","479","Though M_this M_neatly M_solves the problem of how man can M_make history while M_at the same time history M_makes him , it does not M_answer the M_larger question of how a multiplicity of the M_products of individual acts , ‘ totalizations ’ , can themselves be totalized M_into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary , M_blind and self-cancelling M_movements of , M_say , Hardy 's immanent will ."
"cty-fragment03","480","Sartre 's fundamental thesis , that ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations ’ ( I , 15 ) , does not M_in itself M_answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre : ‘ how do M_separate , M_antagonistic actions M_yield a history ; how do individual totalizations M_lead M_to Totalization ( and also M_progress , the M_direction of history , its truth and its meaning ) ? ’"
"cty-fragment03","481","For the M_whole basis of Sartre 's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical M_law , ‘ some M_powerful unitary M_force M_revealing itself M_behind History like the will of God ’ , but the M_continuously M_produced effect of individual conflicts ; each action is M_in its M_turn subsumed as a M_part of the whole M_in an ever M_broader , developing totalization ( I , 37 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","482","What Sartre needs to demonstrate , therefore , is that if the M_law of the dialectic M_works M_from the individual M_level , overall it M_produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such :"
"cty-fragment03","483","The dialectic is the M_law of totalization which creates several collectivities , several societies , and one history — realities , that is , which M_impose themselves M_on individuals ; but M_at the same time it must be M_woven M_out M_of millions of individual actions ."
"cty-fragment03","484","We must M_show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant … and a totalizing M_force … how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ."
"cty-fragment03","485","( I , 36 )"
"cty-fragment03","486","But what M_produces the overall M_direction of History ?"
"cty-fragment03","487","How does it ‘ continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration ’ ?"
"cty-fragment03","488","Sartre does not attempt to answer M_this question , M_shifting rather M_to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness ."
"cty-fragment03","489","The dialectic is the M_law that remains M_hidden ."
"cty-fragment03","490","M_At the moment , ‘ history is M_made M_without being known ( l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre ) ’ — history constitutes , we might say today , a M_political M_unconscious ."
"cty-fragment03","491","‘ Marxism ’ , M_on the other M_hand , Sartre claims , ‘ is History itself becoming M_conscious of itself ’ ( I , 40 ) : as for Lukács , it is by becoming M_conscious of itself as the M_subject of history that the working class will M_understand history 's meaning — and so M_recognize itself as the meaning of history ."
"cty-fragment03","492","While he M_suggests M_in apocalyptic M_tones M_in The Problem of Method that M_this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to M_take place , and that civil , foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different M_forms of a single class M_struggle , Sartre also M_admits that the M_divorce M_between theory and praxis which ensued M_under Stalinism has generally prevented any M_clear self-consciousness M_among the M_masses ."
"cty-fragment03","493","The ‘ M_detour , of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism 's own M_descent M_into its M_unconscious , resulting M_in a M_dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have M_eluded systematization and subsumption M_into the single meaning of Marxism 's own M_reading of history ."
"cty-fragment03","494","It is therefore , Sartre argues , our historical task to M_make it known , promoting not just the historical process as such , but also the general M_recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be M_seen to M_combine to M_make one history , M_with one meaning — the ‘ Truth of humanity ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","495","Sartre 's M_account thus M_sets M_up the M_articulation of history , univocal meaning , and totality as the indissoluble set of M_elements required for the validation of Marxism , necessary in order to M_save it M_from its M_detour M_from itself ."
"cty-fragment03","496","The problem , however , M_remains how such universals are M_produced M_from the multiplicity of M_initiating individual praxes ."
"cty-fragment03","497","If History is a history of conflict , how could it be both one and M_internally diversified M_without the M_inner M_moving principle of the dialectic ?"
"cty-fragment03","498","How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual , if each action is M_aimed M_at M_destroying the other and results M_in a M_double M_negation M_in which the original M_aims of each action have been M_destroyed by the other ?"
"cty-fragment03","499","If each action negates the M_aim of the other , where is the ‘ unity ’ totalized M_in the conflict ?"
"cty-fragment03","500","How does History constantly totalize itself ?"
"cty-fragment03","501","( I , 817 — 18 ) Sartre M_arrives M_at what he calls ‘ the real problem of History ’ , M_that is how there can be totalization M_without a totalizer , only M_at the very M_end of Volume I. It is not M_until the M_next volume , however , that he intends to M_show how individual actions , separate multiplicities , M_make M_up ‘ one human history , M_with one truth and one intelligibility ’ ( I , 69 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","502","M_Throughout , Sartre has nevertheless M_taken it ‘ for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth ’ ( I , 822 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","503","His History , therefore , is always M_in process : but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be M_assumed ."
"cty-fragment03","504","He thus asserts the Truth of History while constantly M_projecting M_forwards and deferring its proof ."
"cty-fragment03","505","But when the proof M_comes it also M_turns M_out to M_rest M_on the assumption that it is already M_true ."
"cty-fragment03","506","III THE SECOND CRITIQUE :"
"cty-fragment03","507","‘ We are trying to establish the Truth of History'"
"cty-fragment03","508","Sartre M_produces a M_persuasive M_formulation of the M_relation of the individual M_to the determining historical circumstance M_through his concepts of praxis and the M_practico-inert ; it is also obvious M_to him how the M_larger question of History ought to be solved ."
"cty-fragment03","509","He asserts it often enough : ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations , ( I , 15 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","510","But M_in Volume I of the Critique , as we have M_seen , he continually defers the M_demonstration of his proof ."
"cty-fragment03","511","For the ‘ dogmatic dialectic ’ , as he describes dialectical materialism , the M_whole question M_naturally poses no problem , for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already M_operative M_movement of totalization that M_produces them and then M_goes M_beyond them ."
"cty-fragment03","512","But Sartre 's M_dispensing M_with all historicist M_schemas creates the problem of how , M_between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations , there could be ‘ one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process ’ ( II , 13 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","513","He attempts to solve M_this M_through M_matching his M_account of contradiction M_with a new concept M_derived M_from the conjunction of work and labour : ‘ anti-labour ’ ( anti-travail ) , a category of M_negation ."
"cty-fragment03","514","The M_products of a conflict , as well as its M_residues , may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ M_from the original intentions of any of the M_combatants ."
"cty-fragment03","515","Nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history ."
"cty-fragment03","516","Dialectical reason M_encounters such M_products as undecidables :"
"cty-fragment03","517","aporias — because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while M_at the same time M_bearing M_witness M_to the fact that M_this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse M_side of two opposed actions M_in which each M_aims to M_destroy the other ."
"cty-fragment03","518","M_In the dialectical M_perspective , we M_encounter M_these M_objects as productions which are human and provided M_with a future … thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations M_in process ."
"cty-fragment03","519","( II , 20 )"
"cty-fragment03","520","M_This M_means that first , they M_lead M_to results , and second , that the M_internal M_structure of social M_objects M_contains ‘ the double M_negation of themselves and of each constituent M_part by the other ’ ( II , 22 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","521","There is , therefore , M_before any understanding of historic M_agents and M_movements , a certain aporia M_in all social M_ensembles : M_from M_afar they may M_appear M_whole , but M_close M_to , they can be M_seen as M_riddled M_with M_holes ."
"cty-fragment03","522","M_This increasingly M_comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre 's own M_account of History ."
"cty-fragment03","523","M_In the M_context of the negativity of M_this M_formulation , Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization , M_without any independent totalizer or totalizing M_force such as the dialectic , or whether the M_structure of M_negation that he has described M_means that , as for Adorno or Bakhtin , history does not develop positively but , rather , negatively , and is therefore instead detotalizing :"
"cty-fragment03","524","Marxism is rigorously M_true if History is totalization ; it is not so any more if human history M_decomposes M_into a plurality of particular histories , or if , M_in any case , M_within the M_relationship of immanence that characterizes M_struggle , the M_negation of each M_adversary by the other is M_on principle detotalizing ."
"cty-fragment03","525","Certainly , we M_have neither the M_design nor the actual possibility of M_showing M_here the M_full truth of dialectical materialism …"
"cty-fragment03","526","Our M_goal is solely to establish whether , M_in a practical M_ensemble M_torn M_apart by antagonism ( whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are M_reduced M_to one ) the M_breaks themselves are totalizing and M_carried M_along by the totalizing M_movement of the M_ensemble ."
"cty-fragment03","527","( II , 25 )"
"cty-fragment03","528","M_At M_this M_point Sartre M_confronts the possibility that the M_whole project of the Critique , stated so confidently M_on its very first page — ‘ it must be proved that a M_negation of a M_negation can be an M_affirmation ’ ( I , 15 ) — may M_break M_down ."
"cty-fragment03","529","perhaps the Truth of History can not be proved ; its M_direction can not be M_discerned ."
"cty-fragment03","530","Sartre 's M_reaction M_to the M_threat that the M_negation of a M_negation may M_produce a detotalizing effect is to M_introduce a new category , a unifying M_force of a ‘ singularization ’ which M_incarnates the universal : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process ’ , he writes , ‘ then it M_operates everywhere ."
"cty-fragment03","531","M_That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical M_ensemble … and that each singular event totalizes M_in itself the practical M_ensemble M_in the infinite M_richness of its singularity ’ ( II , 26 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","532","Unlike Lukács ' insignificant event M_from which the universal is precariously M_drawn M_out M_through the narrative , Sartre 's singularity M_works synecdochally M_in a conventional antinomy M_with the universal , the M_relation M_between the two M_structured according to the M_familiar nineteenth-century M_model of M_organic M_growth or process M_in which each singular event M_makes M_up the whole while , as he M_puts it , ‘ the whole is entirely present M_in the M_part as its M_present meaning and as its destiny ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","533","Sartre 's ‘ singular universal ’ , therefore , M_begs the question , for it is predicated M_on the assumption that , if there is not a totality as such , then there already is an overall totalization : ‘ If totalization really is an ongoing process … ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","534","M_That developing process is itself totalized M_through Sartre 's M_assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all M_struggles , as it must be if the singular is to M_incarnate the universal ."
"cty-fragment03","535","The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity M_in the argument whereby Sartre can M_avoid the question which he began by posing ."
"cty-fragment03","536","So the singular universal M_presumes the totalization he ca n't ( yet ) prove ."
"cty-fragment03","537","M_This M_strategy M_marks a M_structure of repetition M_in Sartre 's text : each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History M_without a totalizer , he M_retreats M_to a more limited example whose unity is already evident , but which M_in the M_end only M_brings him M_back M_to the original question again ."
"cty-fragment03","538","M_In M_this case Sartre M_demonstrates how the singular universal M_works , by M_appealing M_to the M_concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to M_reproduce the single M_adversaries of the master/slave dialectic ."
"cty-fragment03","539","Its totalization M_takes place M_through its M_incarnation , as M_part of the totality of boxing , M_in the overall M_framework M_within which each individual fight occurs ."
"cty-fragment03","540","Each boxing match , Sartre claims , must be both a unique event and also M_in some M_sense the M_incarnation of all boxing , whose M_rules and conventions it M_follows , and whose past and future history it M_sets itself M_against ."
"cty-fragment03","541","But it is also apparent that M_that totality is not completely known , nor is its future M_shape even presumed ."
"cty-fragment03","542","By totalization , therefore , Sartre does not M_here mean anything like a predetermined M_end or final M_closure of a totality but rather a process of M_mediation M_among the M_parts , M_where each is determined by the other ."
"cty-fragment03","543","No one can predict the future of boxing , either M_at the M_level of particular M_victories or M_defeats , M_in effect a M_structure of repetition , nor M_at the more general M_level of possible modifications or developments of the sport ."
"cty-fragment03","544","Yet each individual bout M_articulates itself M_within the M_framework of the history of boxing , known and unknown ."
"cty-fragment03","545","M_This M_allows Sartre to M_include chance and contingency M_in his scheme ."
"cty-fragment03","546","Since it can not be known as a concept that will M_realize itself M_in the future , Sartre argues instead that the totality only M_produces itself M_in the moment : ‘ The M_incarnation as such is M_at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible M_to a M_pure abstract unity of M_that which it totalizes ’ ( II , 58 ) ."
"cty-fragment03","547","The universal , the totality , can only be known M_through the singular ."
"cty-fragment03","548","But its future M_direction remains unknown and indeterminate ."
"cty-fragment03","549","M_At the same time Sartre M_makes a M_larger , though less persuasive claim that the boxing-match also M_works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence , namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he M_considers to be the basis of conflict in general ."
"cty-fragment03","550","The boxing match ‘ is the public M_incarnation of all conflict ’ ( II , 32 ) , totalizing M_in its own M_struggle the whole of ‘ contemporary irreducibilities and M_fissures ’ ( II , 26 ) :"
"cty-fragment03","551","thus one can and must say … that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole M_in M_movement and that by M_this singularisation , it M_incarnates the M_enveloping totalization which the historical process is ."
"cty-fragment03","552","( II , 58 )"
"cty-fragment03","553","But then he adds , ‘ I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that M_this M_enveloping totalization exists ’ ."
"cty-fragment03","554","So , although it is possible to M_conceive of any event as an M_incarnation of the totality , insofar as it must itself M_make M_up a M_part of M_that totality M_in its determination , unlike the case of the boxing match , M_where we can M_define the overall entity ‘ boxing ’ , it still remains unproven that an overall entity , ‘ History ’ , can be said to exist at all ."
"cty-fragment03","555","For all his use of the M_model of the boxing match , Sartre has really M_got no M_further M_with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization M_without a totalizer ."
"cty-fragment03","556","It is simple enough for him to M_show that a boxing match M_takes place M_within a general totality of ‘ boxing ’ , which is itself only ever present M_in any individual M_incarnation , for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something M_conducted according to general M_rules and a specific social tradition ."
"cty-fragment03","557","But what M_about M_those conflicts that do not M_take place M_within such a constituted social M_system , such as conflictual bourgeois societies which can not be said to be unified , except , as Sartre M_suggests dismissively , by M_appeal M_to a M_lost M_paradise M_before the class M_struggle ?"
"cty-fragment03","558","Such societies M_make the conflicts of history irreducible M_to Sartre 's logic unless , like the boxing match , they can be M_shown to M_take M_part M_in a M_larger totalizable category ."
"cty-fragment03","559","However , when he poses the question of whether his method could M_work as well for the class M_struggle as for the boxing match , Sartre M_admits that he M_finds it impossible to answer and M_returns instead M_to the much easier case of sub-groups ."

"cty-fragment03","561","The major question thus always remains unanswered M_in the Critique : every time that Sartre M_announces that he is M_about to M_proceed M_with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization M_without a totalizer , he M_turns M_back M_to a previous , more easily intelligible M_stage M_on the M_way ."
"cty-fragment03","562","His difficulty is M_accompanied by a no doubt M_symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that , M_in championing specificities M_against them , he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals — History as Totalization — that originally M_formed the M_object of his project ."
"cty-fragment03","563","M_At M_this M_point a further contradiction M_in Sartre 's M_whole enterprise begins to M_open M_up : for someone so M_deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically M_with the notions of totality , History , and the dialectic ."
"cty-fragment03","564","As Sartre insists more and more M_upon the M_virtues of specificity ( II , 200 — 05 ) , such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them , attempting to M_replace concepts M_with specificities , universals M_with singulars ."
"cty-fragment03","565","His scepticism M_goes M_to the M_extent of even denying the existence of ‘ society ’ or ‘ the nation ’ as such ( II , 24 , 61 ) — the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires ."

"ecv-fragment05","1042","Along with a selection M_from a list including women , animals , madmen , foreigners , slaves , patients and imbeciles , children have M_served M_in M_that M_great class of beings , the ‘ not-men ’ , M_in M_contrast M_with which male philosophers have M_defined and M_valued themselves ."
"ecv-fragment05","1043","Unlike the others who M_appear and M_disappear as M_fashion and M_progress M_dictate , children M_occupy a permanent M_place M_in the list partly because of their continuing M_presence as a potential M_sub-class , partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that M_in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention ."
"ecv-fragment05","1044","They have received it M_in the M_shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to M_see them M_through the maturation process M_from infancy M_to adulthood ."
"ecv-fragment05","1045","Generations of philosophers have documented M_this process ."
"ecv-fragment05","1046","Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare 's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to M_come ."
"ecv-fragment05","1047","Education was to M_guide the infant M_through the transition M_to manhood including such M_stages as childhood , boyhood and youth ."
"ecv-fragment05","1048","M_That is the second M_thing to notice ; the philosopher 's children are boys ."
"ecv-fragment05","1049","The fact that at least half of the world 's children would not actually M_go M_through M_this process M_beyond the first two M_stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and , no doubt , the reasons for M_this were largely social ."
"ecv-fragment05","1050","But the neglect of girl children M_through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice , though many might think M_this real and bad enough ."
"ecv-fragment05","1051","Education M_has an M_end ."
"ecv-fragment05","1052","Although it is fashionable to talk M_about its M_value ‘ for its own sake ’ , what M_prompts the theorising is the M_strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child M_turns M_out to be ."
"ecv-fragment05","1053","M_Where the M_end is person- rather than M_role-oriented — that is , M_where the M_end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the M_production of , say , information technologists — then education is M_valued in relation to some M_conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to M_serve ."
"ecv-fragment05","1054","Such an ideal does not M_stand M_isolated M_from the practices which M_strive M_towards it but M_interacts M_with M_those practices , M_helps to M_construct them , and is M_in M_turn M_constructed by them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1055","The M_great philosophers have always M_produced such a person-oriented M_account at least for M_those whose education was thought to matter ."
"ecv-fragment05","1056","Education has been M_directed M_at the M_production of the rational , the M_free , the independent of mind , the dignified , in short , the M_autonomous human being ."
"ecv-fragment05","1057","Yet because the philosopher 's adult has traditionally been male , his children boy children , and his educational programmes M_designed to facilitate the transition M_between them , the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised M_to the M_point M_where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly M_admitted that M_this M_defining ideal is not applicable M_to half the species ."
"ecv-fragment05","1058","Rationality turns M_into M_narrow intellectualism , M_freedom M_into licence , independence M_into isolationism , dignity M_into selfish pride ; the M_autonomous human being M_turns M_out to be no more than a social M_atom M_after all ."

"ecv-fragment05","1065","Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested M_in the M_nature and status of children ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1066","There are , of course , the familiar and obvious reasons M_connected M_with women 's traditional M_role M_in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too ."
"ecv-fragment05","1067","When philosophers M_dismiss women as ‘ not-men ’ they frequently do more than simply lump them M_together M_with children or lunatics ."
"ecv-fragment05","1068","Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other M_company they M_keep ."
"ecv-fragment05","1069","It would be well to know just what M_this M_entails ."
"ecv-fragment05","1070","Schopenhauer M_said that women remain big children all their lives ; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like ."
"ecv-fragment05","1071","A common result of M_this is that when the philosophers deny M_autonomy M_to women , they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny M_it M_to children and cite lack of rationality , capriciousness and vulnerability M_among their characteristics ."
"ecv-fragment05","1072","We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves ; we can ask further questions : are children like M_this ? is M_this why children are not M_autonomous ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1073","Again , women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they M_find it M_offensive ."
"ecv-fragment05","1074","It would therefore be reasonable to M_consider whether children M_find it M_offensive to be treated like children ."
"ecv-fragment05","1075","Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience ?"

"ecv-fragment05","1079","The assumption that all M_groups M_in the ‘ not-men ’ class are identical M_with each other is so M_firmly rooted that , as we shall M_see M_in the fourth M_section , it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that M_showing that , for example , some M_ground for M_distinguishing M_between men and women is M_false or irrelevant , M_immediately M_commits us M_to the M_view that the same M_ground is irrelevant M_in M_distinguishing men M_from children ."

"ecv-fragment05","1120","The traditional M_view is M_encapsulated M_in the claim that children are not M_autonomous ; that is , M_on a standard interpretation , they lack the M_capacity to act rationally M_in M_pursuit M_of their own self-chosen M_goals ."
"ecv-fragment05","1121","It is then a matter of preference whether you M_say that they can not choose the M_goals or that they can not M_form strategies to achieve them or both ."

"ecv-fragment05","1124","M_Beyond M_that , the similarities seem M_remote ."
"ecv-fragment05","1125","There is obviously something wrong M_with a portrayal of children as totally lacking M_in reason until they leap out of bed M_on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act M_on principle ."
"ecv-fragment05","1126","Apart from being false , such an M_account M_leaves no M_room M_in our thinking M_about children for M_things like teaching and learning , or development M_in understanding and character and all M_those other concepts which M_refer M_to processes and not to states ."
"ecv-fragment05","1127","The M_tension M_between M_these theoretical M_views of children as non-rational , M_non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident M_in M_those quotations M_from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill ."
"ecv-fragment05","1128","Children , according to Hobbes , M_have the ‘ possibility apparent ’ of becoming reasonable ."
"ecv-fragment05","1129","M_In what does the possibility consist ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1130","Hobbes is not using an inductive argument M_here ; the ‘ possibility apparent ’ is not an inductive argument M_from M_observations M_about M_past children but is meant to M_refer M_to some discernible M_feature of M_present ones ."
"ecv-fragment05","1131","But what ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1132","Hobbes does not M_tell us , but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not M_have ."
"ecv-fragment05","1133","It is not language since Hobbes is M_here M_talking M_about the prelinguistic child ."
"ecv-fragment05","1134","Perhaps it consists M_in the ability to M_respond intelligently M_to the language of others ."

"ecv-fragment05","1136","M_In any case , if such a qualification is M_called M_for it is M_hard to M_see how a creature M_with no rationality at all could M_possess it ."
"ecv-fragment05","1137","Locke 's remarks are just as puzzling ."
"ecv-fragment05","1138","Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were ."

"ecv-fragment05","1143","Is it just that I talk M_to them that they love ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1144","Maybe , but I can also , if I like , talk M_to my car , but yelling M_at it M_in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational ."
"ecv-fragment05","1145","Lockean children M_have the M_added amazing ability to M_recognise reason M_in you M_without M_possessing any themselves , while Kantian kids , two M_stages M_back M_from rationality , M_have the disconcerting M_habit of getting puzzled and asking questions ."

"ecv-fragment05","1185","Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1186","However much she may enjoy such pursuits , there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied ."
"ecv-fragment05","1187","Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to M_take care of her , who will ?"
"ecv-fragment05","1188","His M_view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends M_upon a M_conception of a child which is M_far M_narrower than even the sex divide ."
"ecv-fragment05","1189","Holt 's child is actually the M_Artful M_Dodger ; mercifully , not all children are ."
"ecv-fragment05","1190","There are other difficulties too ."
"ecv-fragment05","1191","It is not M_clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on M_full political status whether or not they want to , but Holt clearly does not ."
"ecv-fragment05","1192","He proposes that ‘ the rights , privileges , duties , responsibilities of adult citizens be M_made available M_to any young person , of whatever age , who wants to M_make use of them ’ ( Holt , 1974 , p. 15 ) ."
"ecv-fragment05","1193","If Holt thinks that M_this proposal would M_remove an arbitrary M_boundary M_line M_between adults and children , then he is mistaken ."
"ecv-fragment05","1194","The M_point M_about an adult citizen is that he M_has M_these rights , privileges , duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1195","He may not M_exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties , but he can not forgo them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1196","They are not just available M_to him , they are his ."
"ecv-fragment05","1197","M_That is what being a citizen M_involves ."
"ecv-fragment05","1198","Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems M_in the case of children ."
"ecv-fragment05","1199","Holt can and does believe that children should M_have them as adults do , and then M_leaves it M_up M_to the child to decide whether or not to M_exercise them ."
"ecv-fragment05","1200","But the same can not be M_said for duties and responsibilities ."
"ecv-fragment05","1201","Failure to M_exercise one 's rights may be morally neutral ; failure to carry out one 's duties is not ."
"ecv-fragment05","1202","It would be perfectly possible to M_give the rights M_to children M_without imposing the duties M_on them , the one does not M_entail the other , but we would then still be M_distinguishing M_between adults and children as citizens ."
"ecv-fragment05","1203","Children still would not M_have M_full political status ."
"ecv-fragment05","1204","Duties and responsibilities are not merely available M_to a citizen ; they are an M_integral M_part of being a citizen ."
"ecv-fragment05","1205","Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of M_these responsibilities and he M_manages to M_make his M_point by M_concentrating solely M_on the rights so that he can remark :"
"ecv-fragment05","1206","I do not M_say , either , that M_these rights and duties should be M_tied M_into one M_package , that if a young person wants to assume any of them , he must assume them all ."
"ecv-fragment05","1207","He should be able to M_pick and choose ."
"ecv-fragment05","1208","( Holt , 1974 , p. 16 )"
"ecv-fragment05","1209","If he can ‘ M_pick and choose ’ , I suggest , he is not a citizen , he does not M_have M_full political status and he is quite M_distinguishable M_on M_these M_grounds alone M_from the adults M_around him who do not M_have M_this option ."
"ecv-fragment05","1210","Holt and Harris both , M_in the M_end , M_face the same problem ."
"ecv-fragment05","1211","They M_attack the status quo by M_pointing M_out that the reasons M_given for denying rights M_to children are bad reasons , and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all ."
"ecv-fragment05","1212","Whatever else such a strategy may M_achieve , it certainly does not M_manage to M_produce a M_situation M_in which children are politically M_indistinguishable M_from adults and it M_rests M_on M_premises which , unless they can be M_defended , M_gain nothing for any M_defence M_to the M_charge of arbitrariness ."
"ecv-fragment05","1213","WHEN M_IN DOUBT , M_GO M_BACK M_TO ARISTOTLE"
"ecv-fragment05","1214","The trouble M_with all the M_views which we have M_looked M_at is that they M_tie the notion of M_autonomy M_firmly and solely M_to M_that of knowledge M_interpreted M_in either a M_broad or M_narrow M_sense ."
"ecv-fragment05","1215","That it is M_firmly M_tied must be correct ; the inhabitants of M_Brave M_New M_World are not M_autonomous precisely because they are denied M_access M_to relevant information ."
"ecv-fragment05","1216","Relevant knowledge is a precondition of M_autonomy but it is not M_synonymous M_with it ."
"ecv-fragment05","1217","Aristotle M_said something very interesting M_in M_that M_extract M_from the Politics which I quoted earlier ; he M_said that women M_have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks M_full M_authority ."

"faj-fragment17","1643","We start M_with a young man , Thomas Fairfax , in military khaki and flying jacket , climbing into his old biplane and taxiing M_down a runway ."
"faj-fragment17","1644","He adjusts the flaps , zips up his jacket , pulls down his goggles ."
"faj-fragment17","1645","The runway is simply a strip of grass , cleared of rocks ."
"faj-fragment17","1646","The plane M_lurches M_into motion ."
"faj-fragment17","1647","It bounces alarmingly as it M_gathers speed ."
"faj-fragment17","1648","A few Africans , clutching sticks and wearing skins , watch the plane as it M_turns , M_pauses , and then accelerates , M_leaving a M_cloud of dust ."
"faj-fragment17","1649","The plane M_climbs M_reluctantly , one set of M_wings M_dipping M_drunkenly ."
"faj-fragment17","1650","Soon it is passing over the spectacular Rift Valley ."
"faj-fragment17","1651","There is no M_sign of civilization , but herds of zebra and wildebeest and M_clumps of elephants M_marble the valley M_floor ."
"faj-fragment17","1652","Ol Doinyo Lengai ."
"faj-fragment17","1653","A group of Masai is clearing stones from a M_stretch of grassland , in the shadow of the Mountain of God ."
"faj-fragment17","1654","A large white cross has been painted roughly on the ground ."
"faj-fragment17","1655","Claudia Cohn-Casson is sitting under an enormous African fig tree near by , at a camp table spread with a Somali cloth ."
"faj-fragment17","1656","She has in front of her a typewriter , her recorder and her notes ."
"faj-fragment17","1657","A servant is preparing lunch on a fire ."
"faj-fragment17","1658","Claudia hears something ."
"faj-fragment17","1659","She looks up into the sky M_in the direction of Ol Doinyo Lengai ."
"faj-fragment17","1660","We M_catch sight of a small plane circling the mountain ."
"faj-fragment17","1661","It M_dips its M_wings M_in M_acknowledgement of the landing strip , and circles , M_preparing to land ."
"faj-fragment17","1662","Claudia stands up ."
"faj-fragment17","1663","She checks her appearance M_in a mirror hanging on a tree ."
"faj-fragment17","1664","With her lower lip she tucks the upper lip into her mouth for a moment ."
"faj-fragment17","1665","She is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki ."
"faj-fragment17","1666","She adjusts her hat , a round bush hat , and walks towards the makeshift landing strip ."
"faj-fragment17","1667","The plane is taxiing , pursued by a group of running Masai warriors , glorious in their red and purple robes , ochred hair , lion head-dresses and so on ."
"faj-fragment17","1668","Claudia walks over towards the plane ."
"faj-fragment17","1669","She holds her hat on her head with one hand ."
"faj-fragment17","1670","The plane is still now , surrounded by the warriors ."
"faj-fragment17","1671","Fairfax is securing its wheels with rocks ."
"faj-fragment17","1672","He looks up to see her approaching ."
"faj-fragment17","1673","Behind her is Ol Doinyo Lengai ."
"faj-fragment17","1674","Its strange shape has become M_familiar M_to us ."
"faj-fragment17","1675","His face is still dirty M_from the dust and oil , except that around his eyes is a white patch where the goggles were ."
"faj-fragment17","1676","The Masai begin to sing ."
"faj-fragment17","1677","It is a strange , other-worldly noise ."
"faj-fragment17","1678","Claudia and Fairfax approach each other ."
"faj-fragment17","1679","The moment is unnaturally , poignantly , delayed ."
"faj-fragment17","1680","In his uniform , jacket unzipped , he is handsome and smiling ."
"faj-fragment17","1681","The singing of the Masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling ."
"faj-fragment17","1682","Claudia and Fairfax come closer ."
"faj-fragment17","1683","She is serene ."
"faj-fragment17","1684","He is perhaps M_surprised by her composure ."
"faj-fragment17","1685","She kisses him , three times ."
"faj-fragment17","1686","‘ I am so glad you came . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1687","( Her accent is very French but she speaks English M_fluently . )"
"faj-fragment17","1688","‘ Anything to help a friend . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1689","Fairfax is awkward ."
"faj-fragment17","1690","He would like to say something more M_graceful ."
"faj-fragment17","1691","‘ Your face is dirty ."
"faj-fragment17","1692","You look , how you say ? , as a M_raccoon . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1693","Fairfax laughs ."
"faj-fragment17","1694","He wipes his face with his sleeve ."
"faj-fragment17","1695","‘ Sorry . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1696","‘ I have prepared the lunch . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1697","She touches his arm lightly ."
"faj-fragment17","1698","They start to walk the short distance to her camp ."
"faj-fragment17","1699","The throng of Masai surrounds them ."
"faj-fragment17","1700","Her servant brings a bowl of hot water for Fairfax ."
"faj-fragment17","1701","He washes his face ."
"faj-fragment17","1702","The Masai watch all M_this ."
"faj-fragment17","1703","Fairfax and Claudia sit down on camp chairs ."
"faj-fragment17","1704","The Masai stand a short distance off , curious , but self-absorbed ."
"faj-fragment17","1705","‘ What would you like to drink ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1706","‘ Can you M_manage a brandy and soda ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1707","‘ I think so . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1708","She speaks Swahili M_to the servant ."
"faj-fragment17","1709","‘ Now , do you want to tell me all the facts ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1710","‘ As M_far as I know them ."
"faj-fragment17","1711","Yes ."
"faj-fragment17","1712","The Masai who has been arrested , Tepilit , is from M_this district ."
"faj-fragment17","1713","M_These people are from his engang ."
"faj-fragment17","1714","He was supposed to deliver a bull to the district officer , it was M_about three weeks ago , and he decided M_at the last moment to replace the bull with another one ."
"faj-fragment17","1715","But the district officer , Miles Turnbull , would not accept it … ’"
"faj-fragment17","1716","Her face , as she removes her hat and begins to speak , is startlingly beautiful , although not conventionally ."
"faj-fragment17","1717","Fairfax watches her ."
"faj-fragment17","1718","As she talks the servant brings the drinks and then the lunch , a grilled fowl with some preserves ."
"faj-fragment17","1719","As she speaks we see a Masai market ."
"faj-fragment17","1720","M_Spread around are hundreds of Masai men and women ."
"faj-fragment17","1721","Some of the women are in robes of blue , others are in brown , dyed skins ."
"faj-fragment17","1722","The older men have blankets loosely slung over their shoulders ."
"faj-fragment17","1723","Almost every man is M_accompanied by a goat or a cow , held on a short leather thong or M_controlled by a thin stick ."
"faj-fragment17","1724","M_Those animals are accustomed M_to the Masai ."
"faj-fragment17","1725","There is , incongruously , an open car to one side of the market ."
"faj-fragment17","1726","From it , into the colourful throng , appears a young British district officer , Miles Turnbull ."
"faj-fragment17","1727","He is carrying some papers and is accompanied by two askaris with rifles , and an interpreter , dressed in khakis ."
"faj-fragment17","1728","The askaris wear military sweaters , Sam Brownes , shorts and socks ."
"faj-fragment17","1729","On their heads they wear fezes ."
"faj-fragment17","1730","‘ The M_whole M_thing was ridiculous and M_tragic ."
"faj-fragment17","1731","M_This man was very much liked by the Masai ."
"faj-fragment17","1732","But he was overworked ."
"faj-fragment17","1733","He had to collect the cattle and M_make sure that every boma was contributing his M_fair share ."
"faj-fragment17","1734","His district M_stretches nearly one hundred and fifty miles ."
"faj-fragment17","1735","I liked him , even though he was a little bit boring ."
"faj-fragment17","1736","He was so English ."
"faj-fragment17","1737","He could not speak Masai so he always was accompanied by M_this man , a Nandi , who , I am afraid , does not speak Masai very good . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1738","‘ Very well ."
"faj-fragment17","1739","Sorry . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1740","‘ Very well ."
"faj-fragment17","1741","So the laibon 's son from M_up M_there , M_up the valley past Lengai , he is a descendant of Mbatian , the M_great laibon , he tries to persuade Turnbull to let him take out his animal from the ones which have been selected . ‘"
"faj-fragment17","1742","The young warrior , Tepilit , is arguing M_with the district officer ."
"faj-fragment17","1743","He is still vividly scarred M_from his recent M_encounter M_with a lion ."
"faj-fragment17","1744","His face is painted and he is carrying a spear ."
"faj-fragment17","1745","On his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane ."
"faj-fragment17","1746","Turnbull explains M_through the interpreter that time is M_short ; it is late ; there is a M_great war M_on M_with the Germans ."
"faj-fragment17","1747","He can not wait for the proposed exchange of animals ."
"faj-fragment17","1748","But he tries to be reasonable ."
"faj-fragment17","1749","‘ How M_long will it M_take , anyway ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1750","‘ Tomorrow it will be ready ."
"faj-fragment17","1751","I will bring it . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1752","‘ It will be too late ."
"faj-fragment17","1753","Tell him that I am very sorry but I can not M_make exceptions ."
"faj-fragment17","1754","He has M_had plenty of time . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1755","The Masai warrior , Tepilit , is excited ."
"faj-fragment17","1756","A number of other Masai gather round ."
"faj-fragment17","1757","He says that M_this particular animal is a favourite ."
"faj-fragment17","1758","He strokes its side , which is white and marked with round patches of black , like M_islands M_on a M_naïvely M_drawn M_map ."
"faj-fragment17","1759","It is a beautiful animal , with huge , curved horns ."
"faj-fragment17","1760","‘ I will bring you two cattle tomorrow ."
"faj-fragment17","1761","I will go now and deliver them myself to Narok . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1762","‘ Tell him I am very sorry , but I must M_fill the quota . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1763","Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated ."
"faj-fragment17","1764","‘ Take the animal now , ’ he says M_to his assistant gently ."
"faj-fragment17","1765","As they move forward , Tepilit , M_without warning , hurls his spear M_at the district officer from a few feet away ."
"faj-fragment17","1766","It is a heavy weapon ."
"faj-fragment17","1767","Between the knife-shaped iron blade and the tapered M_tail of the spear is a rounded handle made from a particularly hard tree ."
"faj-fragment17","1768","M_This piece of wood passes right through Turnbull , so that he is skewered ."
"faj-fragment17","1769","A M_fountain of blood at first pours from his chest , but soon M_subsides become a M_steady trickle ."
"faj-fragment17","1770","Tepilit watches as the district officer performs a M_brief M_hokey-cokey before falling face down ."
"faj-fragment17","1771","M_This drives the spear almost completely through his body ."
"faj-fragment17","1772","Nobody moves ."
"faj-fragment17","1773","The watching Masai begin to walk away M_after a M_long , contemplative moment ."
"faj-fragment17","1774","They seem to be M_weighing the incident carefully M_in their minds ."
"faj-fragment17","1775","The askaris panic ."
"faj-fragment17","1776","They M_cock their rifles and fire into the air ."
"faj-fragment17","1777","Now they guard the body , which is motionless in a M_lake of blood that is rapidly M_drying , M_drunk by the M_thirsty , M_insatiable soil ."
"faj-fragment17","1778","You can almost hear the soil M_gulping ."
"faj-fragment17","1779","Tepilit drives his bull away ."
"faj-fragment17","1780","He walks M_without a backward glance ."
"faj-fragment17","1781","He has in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog ."
"faj-fragment17","1782","M_This little group begins to mount a hill ."
"faj-fragment17","1783","Nobody M_makes a move to stop him ."
"faj-fragment17","1784","The strange singing of the Masai M_rises ."
"faj-fragment17","1785","From a distance we see Tepilit , walking steadily towards Ol Doinyo Lengai with his animals ."
"faj-fragment17","1786","They are tiny figures in a huge landscape ."
"faj-fragment17","1787","Fairfax has finished eating , but Claudia 's food is untouched ."
"faj-fragment17","1788","‘ The next day he presented himself for arrest . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1789","‘ Did you know M_this man ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1790","‘ I knew his family well . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1791","‘ Did you see him after the killing ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1792","‘ He came to my house and told me what had happened . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1793","‘ And you told him to give himself up ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1794","‘ Of course ."
"faj-fragment17","1795","What else should I do ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1796","‘ I 'm just asking ."
"faj-fragment17","1797","If I can do anything I must know the facts . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1798","‘ The facts are not so M_clear ."
"faj-fragment17","1799","M_This man , Tepilit , was injured helping me M_with the filming of a lion hunt ."
"faj-fragment17","1800","Now I must help him . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1801","‘ When is the trial ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1802","‘ It 's not arranged yet ."
"faj-fragment17","1803","But I have tried to talk M_to him , to persuade him to say that he thought the askaris were going to shoot him or that it was a misunderstanding , but he refuse absolutely to excuse himself . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1804","‘ I 'll talk M_to him ."
"faj-fragment17","1805","I 'll talk M_to the DC ."
"faj-fragment17","1806","I heard M_about the lion hunt ."
"faj-fragment17","1807","Sounds a M_bit of a balls-up . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1808","‘ A balls-up ?"
"faj-fragment17","1809","It was worse than a balls-up ."
"faj-fragment17","1810","It was a disaster ."
"faj-fragment17","1811","His brother was killed ."
"faj-fragment17","1812","All for a film ."
"faj-fragment17","1813","And M_that M_bastard , un vrai salaud — do you speak French ? — Leavitt walked away very happy . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1814","‘ He was the producer ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1815","‘ He was an exploiter ."
"faj-fragment17","1816","He did n't care M_about the Masai ."
"faj-fragment17","1817","He wanted blood , any blood ."
"faj-fragment17","1818","Lions , Masai , all equal . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1819","‘ Why do you think he did it ?"
"faj-fragment17","1820","The moran , I mean ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1821","‘ I do n't know . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1822","There is a pause ."
"faj-fragment17","1823","‘ Shall we M_take some coffee now ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1824","Claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot ."
"faj-fragment17","1825","‘ I 'll go and see him tomorrow ."
"faj-fragment17","1826","Do n't M_worry . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1827","The jail at Ngiro Narok ."
"faj-fragment17","1828","It is a small police post with cells at the M_back ."
"faj-fragment17","1829","In front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass ."
"faj-fragment17","1830","In the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the Union Jack hangs ."
"faj-fragment17","1831","A car pulls up outside ."
"faj-fragment17","1832","An askari salutes as Fairfax steps out of the car in uniform ."
"faj-fragment17","1833","He enters the building ."
"faj-fragment17","1834","A young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly ."
"faj-fragment17","1835","He straightens up and salutes Fairfax ."
"faj-fragment17","1836","‘ Sorry , Major ."
"faj-fragment17","1837","I 'm Sergeant Jeavons , sir . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1838","‘ Major Fairfax ."
"faj-fragment17","1839","I want to talk M_to the Masai man you are M_holding ."
"faj-fragment17","1840","I have the papers . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1841","‘ Are you the M_defence , sir ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1842","‘ No , I 'm here to M_make a report M_to the governor . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1843","The sergeant 's face is M_elaborately M_composed ."
"faj-fragment17","1844","In a M_bare , mud-walled cell , sitting on the floor , is Tepilit ."
"faj-fragment17","1845","He does not appear to be disheartened ."
"faj-fragment17","1846","He looks at Fairfax M_without fear ."
"faj-fragment17","1847","From behind the sergeant , an askari shouts M_at Tepilit ."
"faj-fragment17","1848","‘ Stand up man ."
"faj-fragment17","1849","Attention . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1850","Fairfax speaks M_to Tepilit M_in Maa ."
"faj-fragment17","1851","‘ I hope you are well , Tepilit ole Saibol . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1852","Then he turns to the policeman : ‘ M_That 's M_fine , sergeant ."
"faj-fragment17","1853","You may leave me here . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1854","Fairfax shakes hands with Tepilit and sits on small stool ."

"faj-fragment17","1856","‘ How are you ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1857","‘ I am M_fine . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1858","‘ What age group are you ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1859","‘ Botorok . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1860","‘ Is your father the laibon ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1861","‘ Yes ."

"faj-fragment17","1863","‘ You have killed a lion . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1864","‘ Hooh ."
"faj-fragment17","1865","I am praised because I held it by the tail . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1866","‘ Does your father have many cattle ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1867","‘ We are owners of many cattle . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1868","‘ I am happy ."

"faj-fragment17","1875","‘ Our people also fought the Germans . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1876","‘ Your people fought very bravely . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1877","‘ The Masai are brave . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1878","‘ We know M_this ."
"faj-fragment17","1879","We honour the Masai M_above all people . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1880","‘ What do you want to discuss ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1881","‘ I am here because I was asked to come by Claudia ."
"faj-fragment17","1882","She wants me to talk M_to you . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1883","‘ There is no need ."
"faj-fragment17","1884","I have told her everything that happened . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1885","‘ She is unhappy ."
"faj-fragment17","1886","She does not want you to be tried by the government . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1887","‘ We are betrothed ."
"faj-fragment17","1888","She is my little M_heifer . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1889","Fairfax is M_stunned ."
"faj-fragment17","1890","It M_takes him a moment to regain his composure ."
"faj-fragment17","1891","‘ You are going to be married ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1892","‘ She must first ask her father who lives far away . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1893","‘ Do you realize what will happen M_to you if you are tried ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1894","Tepilit M_makes a gesture by placing his hand to his throat and cupping it ."
"faj-fragment17","1895","‘ I ca n't M_see any M_point M_in M_that ."
"faj-fragment17","1896","When you killed the district officer it was an accident . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1897","‘ I killed him M_on purpose . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1898","‘ What I want to say is M_this , there was a misunderstanding ."
"faj-fragment17","1899","I will tell the government ."
"faj-fragment17","1900","You thought the Nandi , the fat belly , wanted the askaris to shoot you . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1901","‘ No ."
"faj-fragment17","1902","I did not ."
"faj-fragment17","1903","The white man told the askaris to take my animal after I had offered to exchange it ."
"faj-fragment17","1904","He took my best animal , even though I offered two M_in its M_place ."
"faj-fragment17","1905","M_That is why I killed him ."
"faj-fragment17","1906","And now my family have offered forty-nine cattle M_to his family , but the government will not take them to give M_to his family in England . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1907","‘ White men M_have different customs . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1908","‘ They do n't like cattle . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1909","‘ Some like cattle ."
"faj-fragment17","1910","I have many cattle on my farm . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1911","‘ Are they milk cattle living in a house as I have heard ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1912","‘ Not all ."
"faj-fragment17","1913","Many are Masai cattle ."
"faj-fragment17","1914","Tepilit ole Saibol , I M_have a M_heavy M_burden ."
"faj-fragment17","1915","Only you can help me ."
"faj-fragment17","1916","I have to talk M_to the governor ."
"faj-fragment17","1917","I have to explain M_to him what happened ."
"faj-fragment17","1918","The Nandi man has run away , frightened ."
"faj-fragment17","1919","I can say M_to the governor that you misunderstood the M_order and tried to defend yourself ."
"faj-fragment17","1920","Not the district officer 's M_order , but the translator 's who spoke too fast M_without proper consideration , as Nandi people do , and the askaris pointed their guns at you ."
"faj-fragment17","1921","You threw the spear wildly ."
"faj-fragment17","1922","Unfortunately the district officer stepped forward ."
"faj-fragment17","1923","If I tell him M_that they will fine you ."
"faj-fragment17","1924","‘ Many of my people saw me ."
"faj-fragment17","1925","They know that I killed him M_on purpose because he took my best animal . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1926","‘ If you say M_that M_at your trial , they will kill you . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1927","‘ I have offered cattle M_to his family ."
"faj-fragment17","1928","I can do no more . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1929","Fairfax stands up ."
"faj-fragment17","1930","‘ Think M_about what I said ."
"faj-fragment17","1931","I will come back . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1932","‘ Go M_in peace . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1933","‘ Please God . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1934","Tepilit does not stand up ."
"faj-fragment17","1935","He seems content ."
"faj-fragment17","1936","The sergeant meets Fairfax outside the cell ."
"faj-fragment17","1937","‘ All right , sir ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1938","‘ Not really ."
"faj-fragment17","1939","Has he M_made a statement ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1940","‘ Yes , sir ."
"faj-fragment17","1941","He M_admits killing the DO ."
"faj-fragment17","1942","No excuses . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1943","‘ Can I read his statement ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1944","‘ I 'm afraid it 's M_gone M_off to the High Court , sir . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1945","‘ You have n't got a copy here ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1946","‘ We have n't had any carbon paper for two years , sir . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1947","‘ Was it M_taken M_down by a policeman ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1948","‘ Yes , sir ."
"faj-fragment17","1949","By me , sir . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1950","‘ Do you speak Masai ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1951","‘ No , sir , but we got the Larusa translator in ."
"faj-fragment17","1952","He 's the official police translator , sir ."
"faj-fragment17","1953","We read it M_back M_to the man twice ."
"faj-fragment17","1954","It M_took me most of a M_whole day , sir . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1955","In the cell Tepilit sits motionless on the floor ."
"faj-fragment17","1956","At Claudia 's camp it is almost evening ."
"faj-fragment17","1957","The light in the sky is there by M_courtesy of the M_vanished sun , but the tops of the mountains are still M_golden , as though M_honey had been M_poured M_lightly M_over them ."
"faj-fragment17","1958","Fairfax 's car appears , the lights M_hopping and bouncing M_down the track ."
"faj-fragment17","1959","Claudia rises ."
"faj-fragment17","1960","Fairfax steps out of the car ."
"faj-fragment17","1961","Claudia comes to greet him and kisses him lightly on both cheeks ."
"faj-fragment17","1962","‘ How was he ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1963","‘ Stubborn . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1964","‘ He would not agree ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1965","‘ No . ‘"
"faj-fragment17","1966","‘ Would you like something to drink ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1967","They are approaching the fire ."
"faj-fragment17","1968","Fairfax stops ."
"faj-fragment17","1969","‘ He told me you two were pakiteng , little M_heifers . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1970","‘ It 's M_true ."
"faj-fragment17","1971","I did n't know what it M_meant ."
"faj-fragment17","1972","I did not M_take it seriously . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1973","‘ Did you accept any gifts ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1974","‘ He was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace ."
"faj-fragment17","1975","He was M_in a fever ."
"faj-fragment17","1976","I M_had no idea he wanted me to marry him when he has his head shaved . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1977","‘ What a balls-up ."
"faj-fragment17","1978","Claudia , the problem is that one Masai , cruel as M_this may sound , is not considered very important ."
"faj-fragment17","1979","I have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred miles ."
"faj-fragment17","1980","I am supposed to be at GHQ ."
"faj-fragment17","1981","They wo n't M_hold M_up proceedings while we talk M_to him ."
"faj-fragment17","1982","I 've only M_got M_until tomorrow . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1983","‘ Please , Tom . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1984","She touches his arm ."
"faj-fragment17","1985","‘ Please , Tom ."
"faj-fragment17","1986","It is completely crazy ."
"faj-fragment17","1987","There 's a war , the Germans are trying to kill every Jew in the world and you are going to hang one Masai because of a misunderstanding . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1988","‘ There 's no misunderstanding , unfortunately ."
"faj-fragment17","1989","He seems determined to die . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1990","‘ Determined to die ."
"faj-fragment17","1991","Can you talk M_to his family ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","1992","‘ I will try ."
"faj-fragment17","1993","I will also get the translation of his evidence ."
"faj-fragment17","1994","Maybe I can M_put some doubts M_into the governor 's mind M_about its admissibility . ’"
"faj-fragment17","1995","A boma near Ol Doinyo Lengai ."
"faj-fragment17","1996","Fairfax and Claudia are meeting the Masai ."
"faj-fragment17","1997","They are sitting on stools in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking M_to Tepilit 's father , Sentue ."
"faj-fragment17","1998","Around them graceful Masai women in long leather skirts are sweeping the boma and plastering the huts with cow dung ."
"faj-fragment17","1999","M_In the distance we can hear cowbells ."
"faj-fragment17","2000","Sentue is a grand , dignified figure of M_about sixty-five ."
"faj-fragment17","2001","He is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulders is a fur cloak made of the skins of the hyrax ."
"faj-fragment17","2002","In his hands he holds a snuff box , shaped like a small quiver , and a thin stick ."
"faj-fragment17","2003","Two warriors , one of whom is Saibol , Tepilit 's younger brother , stand at a distance ."
"faj-fragment17","2004","Sentue is speaking ."
"faj-fragment17","2005","It is M_clear that he has been speaking for some time ."
"faj-fragment17","2006","‘ We M_have many problems M_with the government ."
"faj-fragment17","2007","They want to take our cows to pay for the war ."
"faj-fragment17","2008","We give them our cows ."
"faj-fragment17","2009","Every time they collect our cows , they promise to give us something M_in return , but the M_next time ask for more cows ."
"faj-fragment17","2010","Our cows are our life ."
"faj-fragment17","2011","I am a rich man ."
"faj-fragment17","2012","I have many cows and many children ."
"faj-fragment17","2013","I have offered many cows to pay M_this man 's family ."
"faj-fragment17","2014","But the government wants to M_take away my son also ."
"faj-fragment17","2015","Why do they do M_this ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","2016","M_This is the M_way our law is ."
"faj-fragment17","2017","You can not kill a man deliberately . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2018","‘ If you have been reasonable , if you are offering your own wealth , two cows instead of one , and he will not listen , if he thinks you are a M_small man and will not listen M_to your suggestions , why not ?"
"faj-fragment17","2019","You must kill him . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2020","‘ You ca n't kill a white man M_in M_this M_way . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2021","‘ A white man has blood , red blood also . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2022","‘ The white man has blood ."
"faj-fragment17","2023","M_That is M_true ."
"faj-fragment17","2024","But the white man does not believe that cattle are payment for M_taking someone 's life . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2025","The Masai , Sentue , M_finds M_this M_hard to believe ."
"faj-fragment17","2026","He turns his old head wearily , as if to indicate M_to his family the kind of people he has to M_deal M_with M_these days ."
"faj-fragment17","2027","Claudia speaks : ‘ Your son must say it was an accident ."
"faj-fragment17","2028","Major Fairfax will speak M_to the government . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2029","‘ I told my son only trouble could M_come M_from being your pakiteng . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2030","The old man says M_this M_without rancour ."
"faj-fragment17","2031","It is , M_in his mind ‘ a fact ."
"faj-fragment17","2032","Claudia is upset ."
"faj-fragment17","2033","She touches Fairfax 's arm for M_support ."
"faj-fragment17","2034","Fairfax shouts : ‘ You are a stupid man ."
"faj-fragment17","2035","M_This woman has come from far away to write M_about your people ."
"faj-fragment17","2036","She did not understand what your son wanted M_from her ."
"faj-fragment17","2037","Why does he want to marry a white woman ?"
"faj-fragment17","2038","Does he think she will M_spend the rest of her life milking his cows and goats ?"
"faj-fragment17","2039","Do n't be stupid . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2040","Sentue M_takes a few moments to reply ."
"faj-fragment17","2041","‘ There is nothing wrong M_with milking cows and goats . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2042","Claudia interrupts ."
"faj-fragment17","2043","‘ Ole Sentue , I agree M_with you ."
"faj-fragment17","2044","I have to go to my country to see my father ."
"faj-fragment17","2045","I am sure he would wish me to marry M_with someone M_in our tribe ."
"faj-fragment17","2046","But M_in any case I can not marry your son ."
"faj-fragment17","2047","In our country to exchange gifts does not M_mean the same M_thing ."
"faj-fragment17","2048","I was a stupid woman ."
"faj-fragment17","2049","I did not understand . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2050","‘ Because you have come here my son is going to be killed ."
"faj-fragment17","2051","Hanged like a M_chicken by his neck , in town . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2052","‘ No , no , please ."
"faj-fragment17","2053","Major Fairfax will help him ."
"faj-fragment17","2054","But he must help himself . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2055","She is weeping ."
"faj-fragment17","2056","Fairfax approaches very close to the laibon , between them ."
"faj-fragment17","2057","The laibon speaks M_to Claudia , ignoring him ."
"faj-fragment17","2058","‘ How can Fahfakhs save him ?"
"faj-fragment17","2059","Your people do not believe it is right to offer cows M_to his family ."
"faj-fragment17","2060","Fahfakhs said M_that ."
"faj-fragment17","2061","They want to kill him ."
"faj-fragment17","2062","He did nothing M_to them , but they want to kill him ."
"faj-fragment17","2063","I have looked at the stones ."
"faj-fragment17","2064","They will kill him . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2065","Fairfax grasps the old man by his wrist ."
"faj-fragment17","2066","‘ Laibon , great-grandson of Mbatian , you must think again ."
"faj-fragment17","2067","The white people are M_having a war M_with the Germans ."
"faj-fragment17","2068","The Masai have been good friends ."
"faj-fragment17","2069","The government will help your son , but he must not say that he killed the white man M_on purpose ."
"faj-fragment17","2070","Ole Sentue Simel , you must speak M_to your son . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2071","The laibon simply looks down at the floor of the boma ."
"faj-fragment17","2072","He is not M_prepared to discuss M_this dishonourable argument ."
"faj-fragment17","2073","His face is adamantine ."
"faj-fragment17","2074","Claudia rises ."
"faj-fragment17","2075","She offers her hand M_in the Masai manner , her head bowed ."
"faj-fragment17","2076","‘ Stay M_in peace ."
"faj-fragment17","2077","Tom , we must go . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2078","‘ Go M_in peace . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2079","They leave the boma ."
"faj-fragment17","2080","The laibon stands to watch them go ."
"faj-fragment17","2081","They walk together towards their car ."
"faj-fragment17","2082","There are tears in Claudia 's eyes ."
"faj-fragment17","2083","She turns to Fairfax ."
"faj-fragment17","2084","‘ He will not talk M_to his son . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2085","He strides stiffly and angrily ."
"faj-fragment17","2086","‘ Claudia , you are supposed to understand them ."
"faj-fragment17","2087","What can he tell him ?"
"faj-fragment17","2088","Can he say M_to him , ‘ You must stop being a Masai ."
"faj-fragment17","2089","You must tell lies like the muzungus ’ ?"
"faj-fragment17","2090","I will try to M_get him M_off ."
"faj-fragment17","2091","But I 'm not so sure now if it 's possible . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2092","‘ You must do it , ’ Tom ."
"faj-fragment17","2093","My work here will be finished if he is hanged ."
"faj-fragment17","2094","I ca n't M_support it ."
"faj-fragment17","2095","It 's too terrible . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2096","They climb into the car and set off ."
"faj-fragment17","2097","Behind them , Ol Doinyo Lengai is M_catching the late afternoon sunlight ."
"faj-fragment17","2098","They drive down into a dry watercourse and are surrounded by hundreds of cattle returning from their grazing , driven by children and young warriors ."
"faj-fragment17","2099","They M_cut the engine to allow the animals to pass undisturbed ."
"faj-fragment17","2100","Claudia sits with her eyes downcast ."
"faj-fragment17","2101","A child greets her , but a young warrior strikes the child with a stick ."
"faj-fragment17","2102","‘ My heart is M_breaking , ’ she says ."
"faj-fragment17","2103","Fairfax turns to her ."
"faj-fragment17","2104","Her face is shaded M_from him in the failing light ."
"faj-fragment17","2105","‘ I will do what I can , I promise . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2106","She kisses Fairfax ."
"faj-fragment17","2107","They sit in the dust of the vanished cattle ."
"faj-fragment17","2108","‘ Claudia , you are beautiful ."
"faj-fragment17","2109","You look so beautiful ."
"faj-fragment17","2110","I ca n't M_bear it that you are unhappy ."
"faj-fragment17","2111","Did you love him ?"
"faj-fragment17","2112","I have to ask . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2113","‘ You know , M_that is an impossible question ."
"faj-fragment17","2114","M_In one M_way I loved them all ."
"faj-fragment17","2115","I have lived here for nearly five years ."
"faj-fragment17","2116","Sometimes for many months I was the only white person for hundreds of miles ."
"faj-fragment17","2117","I was very grateful M_to him ."
"faj-fragment17","2118","I was guilty because he was nearly killed ."
"faj-fragment17","2119","Another man was killed M_in the ridiculous filming ."
"faj-fragment17","2120","I believed I owed him some debt ."
"faj-fragment17","2121","M_That boy will do anything for me , even up to getting himself killed by a lion ."
"faj-fragment17","2122","So I loved him ."
"faj-fragment17","2123","Yes , I loved him , but I loved him M_in my Masai self ."
"faj-fragment17","2124","Do you understand me ?"
"faj-fragment17","2125","Do you know what my professor said ?"
"faj-fragment17","2126","He said that the most important M_thing in the world , I mean our world , is to live la vraie vie ."
"faj-fragment17","2127","I believed I was the first anthropologist in France to understand what M_this M_means ."
"faj-fragment17","2128","I was trying to live the real Masai life . ’"
"faj-fragment17","2129","‘ Is M_that possible ? ’"
"faj-fragment17","2130","‘ Obviously not ."
"faj-fragment17","2131","But at least I was not trying to M_stand completely M_outside M_this life with my little notebook ."
"faj-fragment17","2132","I ca n't leave M_this district M_with one man hanged and another killed and somehow because of me ."
"faj-fragment17","2133","I ca n't ."
"faj-fragment17","2134","My life would be M_finished ."
"faj-fragment17","2135","You have to help me , Tom . ’"

"kb7-fragment31","11204","Careful , slow down !"
"kb7-fragment31","11205","It 's forty mile an hour zone anyway , so he 's M_in the right and you 're M_in the wrong anyway ."
"kb7-fragment31","11206","It is not a forty mile an hour zone , so you 're M_in the wrong !"
"kb7-fragment31","11207","What , when you 're getting into town ?"

"kb7-fragment45","13188","It 's the words they 're interested M_in , not what you actually say and the"
"kb7-fragment45","13189","words that people are using I 've got now , so I do n't even think of it , it 's just there and I just talk normal M_that 's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you 're doing , then you tell them and it and you say , if you do n't wish to be M_on it , well"

"kbh-fragment04","298","Mm ."

"kbh-fragment04","306","It looked like M_that , did n't it ?"
"kbh-fragment04","307","Carol was swaying at her ."
"kbh-fragment04","308","You missed M_that ."
"kbh-fragment04","309","I just swayed at her , and she"
"kbh-fragment04","310","It 's Conway Twitty is n't it ?"
"kbh-fragment04","311","Is it ?"
"kbh-fragment04","312","Oh no ."
"kbh-fragment04","313","How M_far M_back does this M_go , I suppose early fifties ?"
"kbh-fragment04","314","Er nineteen fifty six ."
"kbh-fragment04","315","I remember Conway Twitty ."
"kbh-fragment04","316","Oh yes ."
"kbh-fragment04","317","You were in your cradle ."
"kbh-fragment04","318","Elvis , did n't he ?"
"kbh-fragment04","319","I do n't think he ever recorded it , I think he just used to sing it M_at his , er sort of cabaret ."
"kbh-fragment04","320","Well so many of M_these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that , that ."
"kbh-fragment04","321","Because there 's one there , one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone , ca n't remember which one , probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own does n't he ?"
"kbh-fragment04","322","Well he has done other people 's ."
"kbh-fragment04","323","Well there 's one on there , I ca n't remember"
"kbh-fragment04","324","Like for instance the , er , what do they call M_those two ?"
"kbh-fragment04","325","Oh the two brothers ."
"kbh-fragment04","326","M_In the"
"kbh-fragment04","327","Everley Brothers ?"
"kbh-fragment04","328","The Everley Brothers , M_that 's it ."
"kbh-fragment04","329","You know , Wake up Little Suzie ?"
"kbh-fragment04","330","Oh yeah ."
"kbh-fragment04","331","Well Simon and Garfunkel did M_that"
"kbh-fragment04","332","M_Wicked far out ."
"kbh-fragment04","333","it 's a groovy record this ."
"kbh-fragment04","334","Shut up ."
"kbh-fragment04","335","Ca n't remember which one it is but I 'll recognise it when I hear it ."
"kbh-fragment04","336","He 's doing very well , is n't he ."
"kbh-fragment04","337","He is ."
"kbh-fragment04","338","Have to employ him full time ."
"kbh-fragment04","339","He 's always quite good ."
"kbh-fragment04","340","I just ca n't believe how daft he is ."
"kbh-fragment04","341","I suppose you like M_that film ."
"kbh-fragment04","342","Yes ."
"kbh-fragment04","343","Forget it ."
"kbh-fragment04","344","You 're not having cake ."
"kbh-fragment04","345","Does she like cake ?"
"kbh-fragment04","346","Well she 's looking at it ."
"kbh-fragment04","347","So how 's M_things M_down at the ?"
"kbh-fragment04","348","Not too bad ."
"kbh-fragment04","349","Quite good actually ."
"kbh-fragment04","350","Yeah ?"
"kbh-fragment04","351","Keeping him busy out M_on estimates and"
"kbh-fragment04","352","Yeah he 's out all M_this week ."
"kbh-fragment04","353","Well , my dad wo n't M_pass them M_onto Terry ."
"kbh-fragment04","354","Me dad said he 's M_had enough Well , we were debating whether to M_give it M_to you or not ."
"kbh-fragment04","355","But I thought , well if Terry notices he might ."
"kbh-fragment04","356","Well M_in fact two really M_big estimates"
"kbh-fragment04","357","Who , Terry ?"
"kbh-fragment04","358","Yeah ."
"kbh-fragment04","359","And one M_wanted re-estimating , the other one M_wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done ."
"kbh-fragment04","360","We M_give them a provisional kind of price and not really M_gone M_into it M_in M_detail ."
"kbh-fragment04","361","So she had a list of M_about five M_things she wanted M_sorted M_out and she said so M_far we were the cheapest ."
"kbh-fragment04","362","But she 's M_got M_about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes ."
"kbh-fragment04","363","So I worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all M_down M_to Terry to M_sort M_those M_out ."
"kbh-fragment04","364","And they 're both , M_about two M_to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two M_to three thousand pounds worth of work ."
"kbh-fragment04","365","Well you ca n't afford to M_lose them , can you ?"
"kbh-fragment04","366","No ."
"kbh-fragment04","367","So what 's going to happen then ?"
"kbh-fragment04","368","God knows ."
"kbh-fragment04","369","He said , I asked , asked , well I left a message M_on Saturday for him to M_sort them M_out did n't I ?"
"kbh-fragment04","370","He already knew M_about M_that ."
"kbh-fragment04","371","And then I asked my father M_on Tuesday to remind him and he said , he 'd already said he 'd M_fetch them M_in M_on Tuesday ."
"kbh-fragment04","372","And he , my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would M_have them M_by tomorrow morning ."
"kbh-fragment04","373","But he 's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices ."
"kbh-fragment04","374","So I do n't know ."
"kbh-fragment04","375","Well , I mean he 'd done , he 's done M_this first estimate , M_these are all just M_polishing M_touches cos people are obviously interested M_in , you know they 're well M_keen M_on our prices ."
"kbh-fragment04","376","they ca n't M_pursue it till we come back to them ."
"kbh-fragment04","377","They 're not M_pursuing it until we M_put M_these M_things M_out ."
"kbh-fragment04","378","My father just turned round I 've M_had enough of it if Terry 's not going to do the estimate he M_passes them M_on M_to Brian ."
"kbh-fragment04","379","I said yeah then I M_get M_into trouble M_with them for not M_passing estimates M_to Terry and then there 's an argument ."
"kbh-fragment04","380","If he , if he says anything M_to me I 'll just have to tell him ."
"kbh-fragment04","381","But he 's not doing the estimates he 's been M_given and he ca n't afford to M_throw money M_away ."
"kbh-fragment04","382","It 's cos he 's working for him M_at the moment money ."
"kbh-fragment04","383","He always gets like M_that and then he forgets M_after like a month or two when he has n't worked for him ."
"kbh-fragment04","384","He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he M_swings the other M_way ."
"kbh-fragment04","385","I mean Brian 's pulled in a M_lot of work ."
"kbh-fragment04","386","M_lot of people kind of saying come back again M_on Thursday So he 's , he 's ."
"kbh-fragment04","387","If we M_got Terry to do M_that we 'd be well M_away ."
"kbh-fragment04","388","They , they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry 's just not M_pulling his M_weight ."
"kbh-fragment04","389","I do n't understand it , if I live to be a hundred I wo n't understand it ."
"kbh-fragment04","390","And also , it 's cos that , you know after we M_had M_that row M_about Terry , M_after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop , and er he 's already owing Brian a day ?"
"kbh-fragment04","391","Guess who 's doing the extra day ? M_got my dad to M_cover a day ."
"kbh-fragment04","392","And then he M_takes a day M_off Bank Holidays ."
"kbh-fragment04","393","and he ca n't do it because my dad ."
"kbh-fragment04","394","But then tomorrow he 's actually doing his own work ."
"kbh-fragment04","395","So he could easily have ."
"kbh-fragment04","396","And M_on Monday"
"kbh-fragment04","397","So who 's M_covering tomorrow ?"
"kbh-fragment04","398","Well my brother 's M_covered practically all week and Brian 's doing tomorrow ."
"kbh-fragment04","399","Terry phoned up asking what , Tuesday morning M_about quarter M_past eight said who was M_covering ."
"kbh-fragment04","400","And he said well my father is doing today I ca n't do today I 'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you should n't be going in ."
"kbh-fragment04","401","I mean he has n't been in the shop once M_this week ."
"kbh-fragment04","402","Somebody 's got to tell him to"
"kbh-fragment04","403","So do Dave and Terry in the shop ."
"kbh-fragment04","404","They have the records ."
"kbh-fragment04","405","And it has n't been M_sorted yet ?"
"kbh-fragment04","406","Oh no ."
"kbh-fragment04","407","He 's M_got the M_gall to phone up M_on Tuesday and say Eileen ca n't do a day , we 're going to be M_short of Eileen ."
"kbh-fragment04","408","So the M_answer is to just phone them ."
"kbh-fragment04","409","I ca n't do it ."
"kbh-fragment04","410","I 'm not doing it ."
"kbh-fragment04","411","What 's the M_point of carrying on like M_that ?"
"kbh-fragment04","412","Well he 's going to carry on like M_that is n't he ?"
"kbh-fragment04","413","Not unless someone M_puts their M_foot M_down ."
"kbh-fragment04","414","And if your father is currently M_taking your M_side of M_things M_worth sounding him out as to how M_far he 'll M_take"
"kbh-fragment04","415","Ah"
"kbh-fragment04","416","whilst he 's M_in the mood ?"
"kbh-fragment04","417","Yeah ."
"kbh-fragment04","418","He 's not being M_that much"
"kbh-fragment04","419","You sure ?"
"kbh-fragment04","420","Mmm ."
"kbh-fragment04","421","He 's probably only M_in the mood cos he 's probably M_upsetting them M_on his night out cos they go out M_in the evenings ."
"kbh-fragment04","422","M_On a Wednesday evening , do n't they ."
"kbh-fragment04","423","Cos Terry"
"kbh-fragment04","424","I mean , would n't he rather M_have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway ?"
"kbh-fragment04","425","It 's not being M_fair"
"kbh-fragment04","426","do any work ."
"kbh-fragment04","427","Oh what , your dad ?"
"kbh-fragment04","428","Pauline 's dad er"
"kbh-fragment04","429","too expensive I think ."
"kbh-fragment04","430","Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often , uses my dad ticking over running when he"
"kbh-fragment04","431","Why ."
"kbh-fragment04","432","He does M_get the offer , I mean"
"kbh-fragment04","433","two months and she phoned up and I kind of M_made M_out it got lost M_in the post ."
"kbh-fragment04","434","I erm got , check you 've M_got two days , you 've got M_give me the estimate , it 's got to be M_on because she 's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent ."
"kbh-fragment04","435","And he actually got M_that one done ."
"kbh-fragment04","436","Do you know it was only five M_lines ."
"kbh-fragment04","437","I mean I could have M_made it M_up it was M_that easy ."
"kbh-fragment04","438","So I sent M_that off ."
"kbh-fragment04","439","She was in first M_thing , I mean I sent it off M_that evening she was in first M_thing the M_next morning yes M_that 's M_fine ."
"kbh-fragment04","440","So he 's M_got M_that job and another one ."
"kbh-fragment04","441","She 's trying is n't she ?"
"kbh-fragment04","442","I do n't understand why it surprises you , M_that 's what M_gets me ."
"kbh-fragment04","443","I mean"
"kbh-fragment04","444","It 's normal behaviour ."
"kbh-fragment04","445","Charlotte 's done it too ."
"kbh-fragment04","446","Can you pass me that er , M_sheet ?"
"kbh-fragment04","447","This ?"
"kbh-fragment04","448","Is that your reading ?"
"kbh-fragment04","449","That 's not your regulations you have to read is it ?"
"kbh-fragment04","450","Oh no , that 's a"
"kbh-fragment04","451","I was going to say that does n't seem very thick"
"kbh-fragment04","452","No , that 's to M_do M_with this tape ."
"kbh-fragment04","453","Oh I tell you what is quite funny these , the act ."
"kbh-fragment04","454","Mmm ."
"kbh-fragment04","455","Oh ."
"kbh-fragment04","456","hereby enacted her gracious majesty , you know , etcetera etcetera ."
"kbh-fragment04","457","What was it , the Lords temporal and spiritual , M_that 's what they call themselves ."
"kbh-fragment04","458","Now M_that is , M_that 's"
"kbh-fragment04","459","Yes ."
"kbh-fragment04","460","Yeah I realise and I hope I do n't M_come M_into M_contact M_with too many acts of parliament ."
"kbh-fragment04","461","Oh , we M_had someone round to see the house yesterday ."
"kbh-fragment04","462","Oh yeah ?"
"kbh-fragment04","463","They came twenty minutes early , there 's Brian up in the shower , there 's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs ."
"kbh-fragment04","464","M_That 's an M_old M_trick ."
"kbh-fragment04","465","I said M_to Danny , do n't open the door ."
"kbh-fragment04","466","Do n't open the door !"
"kbh-fragment04","467","So as I 'm still trying to stuff things away , she opened the door and everything fell out ."
"kbh-fragment04","468","look round the front room , then they looked round the , the garden ."
"kbh-fragment04","469","While they were looking round the garden I you 've got to get out the shower quick ."
"kbh-fragment04","470","I do n't know ."
"kbh-fragment04","471","They 'd M_come M_down from , they 'd M_come M_down from , erm , somewhere or other ."
"kbh-fragment04","472","They 're just doing a kind of tour of M_loads and M_loads of houses cos they keep moving M_with his job ."
"kbh-fragment04","473","Oh , right ."

"kbw-fragment09","3847","Would n't be too bad cos you 'd go M_down by the Jolly Farmer ."
"kbw-fragment09","3848","Yeah ."
"kbw-fragment09","3849","You 'd have to walk like Gemma walks to school would n't you ?"

"kbw-fragment09","3859","But she could walk it from her house could n't she ?"
"kbw-fragment09","3860","She could ."
"kbw-fragment09","3861","Because it 's not far ."
"kbw-fragment09","3862","Yeah all she has to do is go go round her bit round just a normal road , across the road M_down a M_little M_bit and she 's there ."

"kbw-fragment09","3885","M_That 's M_true ."
