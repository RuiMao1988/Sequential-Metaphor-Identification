a1e-fragment01,1,"Latest corporate unbundler M_reveals laid-back M_approach : Roland Franklin , who is M_leading a 697m pound break-up bid for DRG , talks M_to Frank Kane"
a1e-fragment01,2,By FRANK KANE
a1e-fragment01,3,"IT SEEMS that Roland Franklin , the latest unbundler to appear in the UK , has M_made a M_fatal error M_in the preparation of his å£697m break-up bid for stationery and packaging group DRG ."
a1e-fragment01,4,He has not properly investigated the M_target 's dining facilities .
a1e-fragment01,5,"The 63-year-old M_head of Pembridge Investments , M_through which the bid is being M_mounted says , ‰Û÷ M_rule number one M_in M_this business is : the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at M_headquarters , the more inefficient the business ‰Ûª ."
a1e-fragment01,6,"If he had M_taken his own rule seriously , he would have found out that DRG has a very M_modest self-service canteen at its Bristol M_head office ."
a1e-fragment01,7,"There are other M_things he has , M_on his own M_admission , not fully investigated , like the value of the DRG properties , or which M_part of the DRG business he would M_keep M_after the break up ."
a1e-fragment01,8,"When the bid was M_launched last week , Mr Franklin M_faced some criticism M_from City commentators M_on both M_those M_counts ."
a1e-fragment01,9,He M_regards the M_charges as unfounded .
a1e-fragment01,10,"M_On property , he is M_blunt ."
a1e-fragment01,11,‰Û÷ I do not M_regard property profits as earnings .
a1e-fragment01,12,"We have M_made a bid of nearly å£700m for a company M_with a book value of å£200m ‰ÛÓ we 've acknowledged there is some extra worth M_there , but I can not M_see the sort of value they are talking M_about M_in property ."
a1e-fragment01,13,"If they can prove it is M_there , we might pay for it , ‰Ûª"
a1e-fragment01,14,M_On the other criticism he is equally dismissive .
a1e-fragment01,15,"‰Û÷ M_That M_point M_about the core business is very unfair , ‰Ûª he says ."
a1e-fragment01,16,It is difficult to decide when you are an outsider what the business is like .
a1e-fragment01,17,"We would eventually like to do it along with the management , M_within the philosophy we will impose . ‰Ûª"
a1e-fragment01,18,The Franklin philosophy was learnt M_in the US leveraged buyout business M_at the M_side of Sir James Goldsmith .
a1e-fragment01,19,"Mr Franklin went there M_at the M_end of the 1970s , M_after the M_collapse of Keyser Ullman , the merchant bank where he was a director that was rescued by the Bank of England ."
a1e-fragment01,20,He M_feels that Keyser 's problems were hastened by an unwise acquisition .
a1e-fragment01,21,He went to the US because ‰Û÷ Goldsmith decided that if you wanted to be a capitalist the UK and France were not the places to be ‰Ûª .
a1e-fragment01,22,"Along with Sir James he M_found the US much more M_attractive , taking over and M_breaking M_up some fairly M_hefty US corporations ."
a1e-fragment01,23,He rejects M_charges that he was partly responsible for the ‰Û÷ M_casino M_atmosphere ‰Ûª that M_gripped US corporate M_life M_in the early 1980s .
a1e-fragment01,24,"‰Û÷ We M_stirred it M_up , yes , but we never M_lost any money for anybody and we never M_added M_to the unemployment figures . ‰Ûª"
a1e-fragment01,25,What he has learned M_from Goldsmith ( ‰Û÷ the only genius I have ever M_come M_across ‰Ûª ) is that the holding company is not the most important unit of corporate organisation .
a1e-fragment01,26,‰Û÷ The concept of the company does not interest me - it 's the businesses that are important .
a1e-fragment01,27,It does not matter whether or not DRG M_makes sellotape or Basildon Bond ‰ÛÓ it 's of no consequence M_to anybody if somebody else makes them . ‰Ûª
a1e-fragment01,28,And there is always the ultimate unbundler 's M_defence ‰ÛÓ that he will M_make money for his backers .
a1e-fragment01,29,"M_In a takeover campaign that has already M_seen vitriolic language , he responds M_to the M_charge that he is M_mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying : ‰Û÷ Nobody could M_take M_that as a criticism ‰ÛÓ M_this is an investor group ."
a1e-fragment01,30,It would be a criticism if I was doing it to impoverish myself ‰Ûª .
a1f-fragment06,142,Letter : Policy and politics M_at the Labour Party Conference
a1f-fragment06,143,From MR DAVID SOSKIN
a1f-fragment06,144,"Sir : I was interested by your juxtaposition of ‰Û÷ Poll M_predicts 42-seat majority for Labour ‰Ûª M_with ‰Û÷ Tories M_hold M_on ‰Ûª ( 30 September ) , the latter referring , of course , M_to the Conservative victory in Wandsworth , the significance of which M_appears to have been almost totally ignored by the media ."
a1f-fragment06,145,"Electors are always M_prepared to criticise the Government in answer to pollsters ' questions , but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply can not M_bring themselves to vote Labour M_into M_power ."
a1f-fragment07,146,Letter : Policy and politics M_at the Labour Party Conference
a1f-fragment07,147,From MS MOLLY MEACHER
a1f-fragment07,148,"Sir : Despite a significant M_gap M_in the Labour Party 's education and training proposals , their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds M_in full-time education must be M_welcomed ( 28 September ) ."
a1f-fragment07,149,England 's full-time M_staying-on rate M_stands M_at 28 per cent according to the latest statistics available .
a1f-fragment07,150,"M_This compares M_with 79 per cent in the US , 86 per cent in Sweden , 45 per cent in West Germany and 69 per cent in Japan ."
a1f-fragment07,151,To M_add the part-time education and training statistics M_to M_those figures does not improve our relative M_position .
a1f-fragment07,152,Labour M_hopes to transform the M_situation by increasing the number of M_A-levels M_to five for the M_brighter youngsters and providing grants for four-year training M_courses ( two years in a M_Further Education college M_followed by two M_with an employer ) for the rest .
a1f-fragment07,153,M_These reforms will only M_achieve their objective if M_accompanied by the implementation of the 1944 Education Act provision for compulsory part- or full-time education or training up to the age of 18 .
a1f-fragment07,154,M_This clause has never yet been M_activated .
a1f-fragment07,155,The sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably M_lead employers to bid M_up the wages of M_that age M_group to entice young people M_away M_from education and M_into M_unskilled or M_semi-skilled jobs .
a1f-fragment07,156,Employers must be required to M_release 16-18-year-olds for education and training for at least two days per week .
a1f-fragment07,157,"Only M_then will two vitally important and complementary M_goals be achieved : to improve Britain 's general educational and M_vocational competence , and hence our M_productive capacity ; and to M_reduce our gross educational inequalities M_between the elite who receive a M_narrow education M_to a very M_high M_standard , and the rest ."
a1f-fragment08,158,Letter : Policy and politics M_at the Labour Party Conference
a1f-fragment08,159,From MR JOHN PERTWEE
a1f-fragment08,160,Sir : Labour does not M_need a commitment M_to proportional representation in order to M_scoop most of the M_centre M_ground M_at the M_next general election .
a1f-fragment08,161,"All it M_needs is to promise a high-powered investigation , such as a Royal Commission , M_into the practicalities of an alternative voting M_system ( surely justified by the intense public interest now abounding ) ."
a1f-fragment08,162,Such a promise would be the only hope of a breakthrough for the disenfranchised voters and would have them flocking M_to the polls for Mr Kinnock .
a1f-fragment08,163,"His problem will be that Mrs Thatcher might decide to do it first , and then she will garner the votes ."
a1f-fragment09,164,Letter : Policy and politics M_at the Labour Party Conference
a1f-fragment09,165,From MR DENIS MacSHANE
a1f-fragment09,166,"Sir : If Labour is to suggest the M_setting M_up of a specialist labour court ( 30 September ) , then such a momentous change M_in the industrial relations M_system M_deserves more discussion , and M_needs to be M_taken M_out M_of the M_hot-house of Labour Party conference politics ."
a1f-fragment09,167,For three reasons such a M_move should be M_welcomed .
a1f-fragment09,168,"First , it would M_bring Britain into line with the best European practice , notably in Germany where local , regional and federal labour courts M_handle problems M_in a M_fair , dispassionate M_way M_based M_on law , precedent and judicial expertise M_in the labour M_field ."
a1f-fragment09,169,"Second , it would ensure that workers M_enjoyed positive M_rights M_under law and M_reduce the M_emphasis of union M_immunities ."
a1f-fragment09,170,"Labour law will always M_reflect the M_balance of M_power M_in society , and a M_fully M_fledged labour court M_system will not M_remove class and fundamental employer-employee differences ."
a1f-fragment09,171,But it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd M_see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have M_seen since 1969 .
a1f-fragment09,172,"Third , a labour division of the M_High Court would contribute M_to the process of M_constitutional reform in Britain which surely is to be a key political issue M_in the 1990s ."
a1f-fragment09,173,The ‰Û÷ trade union question ‰Ûª would cease to M_haunt the Labour Party and while M_that might M_upset some Conservatives it would be good for the country .
a1f-fragment10,174,Letter : Independence of M_no-fixed-abode
a1f-fragment10,175,From The Rev NERISSA JONES
a1f-fragment10,176,"Sir : M_On Saturday you published an advertisement for the 10 extra pages of news and features that you , The Independent , will M_carry M_from 2 October ."
a1f-fragment10,177,‰Û÷ What do independent experts say M_about our 10 extra pages ? ‰Ûª M_asks the advertisement .
a1f-fragment10,178,The supposedly jokey answers are M_illustrated by photographs of people sleeping outside covered by copies of The Independent : they look like M_some of the M_hundreds of M_visitors M_who M_come M_to M_St M_Botolph 'M_s M_Crypt M_Centre for M_homeless M_people M_every M_day .
a1f-fragment10,179,"Given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in London , when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets , but perhaps permanent homelessness , it was terrible to see the M_situation being M_exploited for a joke by your advertisement : ‰Û÷ Just the M_thing now the evenings are M_drawing M_in ."
a1f-fragment10,180,. ‰Û÷ ; ‰Û÷ The added coverage is exactly what I wanted ‰Ûª .
a1f-fragment10,181,How much ‰Û÷ independence ‰Ûª do you suppose a person M_has who exists M_on the M_no-fixed-abode Giro of å£34.90 a week ?
a1f-fragment11,182,Letter : EC immigration checks on trains
a1f-fragment11,183,From The Rev J. GILMORE
a1f-fragment11,184,Sir : The M_contents of Sarah Helm 's article ‰Û÷ Immigration checks to be M_made on trains ‰Ûª ( 25 September ) are extremely worrying .
a1f-fragment11,185,During the recent European Community elections the representatives of EC governments M_promoted the ideal of a border-free Europe M_by 1992 .
a1f-fragment11,186,"Now , it would M_appear M_from M_this article , that M_this ideal is M_shattered and a M_two-tiered Europe is M_on the M_cards ."
a1f-fragment11,187,One for those who travel by aircraft and one for those who travel by train between London and Paris .
a1f-fragment11,188,The presence of immigration officials and police on board trains is comparable M_to the M_scenes of 1930s America where migrant labourers were turned back at state boundaries .
a1f-fragment11,189,What criteria would police and immigration officials use M_in their search for ‰Û÷ potential terrorists ‰Ûª on a train that they could not use at a static checkpoint or airport ?
a1f-fragment11,190,Do terrorists or illegal persons travel exclusively by train ?
a1f-fragment11,191,"M_This is a M_clear example of the M_extension of the Prevention of Terrorism Act M_where criteria for stopping , questioning and searching are purely subjective M_to the official involved ."
a1f-fragment11,192,"Will a person 's accent , dress or skin colour indicate the potential terrorist or , for M_that matter , football hooligan or drug pusher ?"
a1f-fragment11,193,M_This is a M_recipe for fear and anxiety .
a1f-fragment11,194,It may mean the detention of innocent people and indeed their imprisonment .
a1f-fragment12,195,Letter : Cardinal sins
a1f-fragment12,196,From Mr JIMMY DONOGHUE
a1f-fragment12,197,Sir : The North-east publishers of Viz are M_nearer the truth than they realise M_with their soccer strip ( 29 September ) .
a1f-fragment12,198,"Cardinal Hume has not only the M_cross of being a fervent Newcastle United supporter to M_bear ; he is also known M_to irreverent M_members of Mayfair 's Jesuit Farm Street Church by his initials , George Basil Hume ."
a1g-fragment26,387,Latecomers who continue to hope
a1g-fragment26,388,From ANNE APPLEBAUM in Warsaw
a1g-fragment26,389,"DOZENS more East German refugees arrived outside the West German embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the West , including some who M_missed M_by only a few minutes a train that M_took more than 800 of their compatriots to West Germany ."
a1g-fragment26,390,"Many of the new arrivals , who waited in the street outside the embassy , said they were convinced there would be another train for them ."
a1g-fragment26,391,The one they M_missed M_pulled out from Warsaw 's East Station M_at 2.50am yesterday M_carrying 809 cheering East Germans M_bound for the Rhine region of West Germany .
a1g-fragment26,392,Once M_upon a time another German government let Lenin cross another Germany in a sealed train on his way to Russia .
a1g-fragment26,393,"More than 80 years later , Lenin 's heirs are allowing refugees M_from their Communist regime escape M_in the opposite direction , in an East German-made train travelling across East German territory ."
a1g-fragment26,394,"Among those leaving was Cornelia , 22 , a young East Berliner destined , she said , for West Berlin via a very circuitous route ."
a1g-fragment26,395,‰Û÷ I still do n't know if my family know where I am or if they will suffer M_from my decision .
a1g-fragment26,396,But I M_saw no other M_way M_out : I did n't know if I would ever M_have a chance again . ‰Ûª
a1g-fragment26,397,"Some of the refugees had been living M_in Polish exile for as long as seven weeks , while others arrived only a few hours before West German diplomats announced they could leave ."
a1g-fragment26,398,"Only two failed to go : a new mother and her child , who was born in a Polish hospital four days ago ."
a1g-fragment26,399,"The East German government 's M_decision to let the refugees leave across their own country M_came as a surprise M_to many , including some West German diplomats ."
a1g-fragment26,400,"Some of the refugees originally refused to touch East German territory again , but were reassured when two of the West German diplomats said they would M_accompany the train , to ensure that the M_rules were M_followed ."
a1g-fragment26,401,"During the journey , East German officials will enter the train , and collect all East German passports ."
a1g-fragment26,402,West Germans will then issue new ones .
a1g-fragment26,403,"Legally , the refugees have been expelled from East Germany , meaning that M_under current M_rules they can not return ."
a1g-fragment26,404,"According to unofficial reports , the M_arrangement was M_designed by the West German Foreign Minister , Hans Dietrich Genscher , the new Polish foreign minister , Krzystof Skubiszewski , and the Soviet Foreign Minister , Eduard Shevardnadze , who met recently at the United Nations in New York ."
a1g-fragment27,405,Communists allow burial of Montenegro 's last king
a1g-fragment27,406,"From MARCUS TANNER in Cetinje , Yugoslavia"
a1g-fragment27,407,"THE PEOPLE of Montenegro yesterday M_welcomed M_home the remains of Nicholas I , their first and last king , M_after 70 years ' exile in Italy , M_in belated fulfilment of his last will and testament ."
a1g-fragment27,408,"Thousands of Montenegrins , many in national costume , waited at the quayside in Bar for the Italian warship that would M_bring him home ."
a1g-fragment27,409,Then they formed a slow procession behind the coffin into the mountains to the old royal capital of Cetinje for his reburial in the monastery there .
a1g-fragment27,410,"What was surely the last ever Montenegrin ‰Û÷ royal event ‰Ûª was masterminded by the republic 's new Communist leadership , which has abruptly stopped M_describing Nicholas as a class enemy , to M_ride the same M_wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which M_swept Serbia M_in the recent celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo ."
a1g-fragment27,411,"The latest biography now M_calls him ‰Û÷ an outstanding statesman , warrior and man of letters ‰Ûª ."
a1g-fragment27,412,"‰Û÷ If I die abroad M_in exile , let my body M_rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland , ‰Ûª said the Montenegrin President , Branko Kostic , reading the royal M_will and testament M_to the crowds in Cetinje Square , who carried flags and portraits of Nicholas and his queen , Milena ."
a1g-fragment27,413,"‰Û÷ Today the people of Montenegro fulfill the wish of their first and last king M_guided by innate love and respect for their history , ‰Ûª he M_went M_on ."
a1g-fragment27,414,"‰Û÷ Our tourist organisations are M_counting M_on M_big profits , ‰Ûª said Srdan Darmanovic , a M_member of the Montenegrin Central Committee ."
a1g-fragment27,415,‰Û÷ M_This will be good for the Montenegrin economy too . ‰Ûª
a1g-fragment27,416,"Montenegro 's M_young and go-ahead leadership , which M_came M_to M_power M_this year M_amid M_furious popular dissatisfaction M_with the ‰Û÷ old men in grey suits ‰Ûª , sponsored the gathering of Nicholas 's surviving relatives ‰ÛÓ the first ‰Û÷ royal reunion ‰Ûª M_organised by a Communist government ."
a1g-fragment27,417,"‰Û÷ A letter dropped M_through the post from the President of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro , inviting me to the funeral , ‰Ûª said John Kennedy , a Conservative Party M_member who lives in Barking and is a M_distant relative of Nicholas ."
a1g-fragment27,418,Montenegro 's sudden M_rehabilitation of Nicholas 's memory is a popular M_move .
a1g-fragment27,419,"‰Û÷ He liberated us M_from the Turks and fought for our independence , ‰Ûª said a small boy who waited at the quayside amid a jostling crowd of former monarchs , visiting Serbian bishops and television crews ."
a1g-fragment27,420,"Marko Radoman , 103 , and a veteran of both Balkan wars , was M_given a place at the front as one of the few M_with personal memories of Nicholas 's reign ."
a1g-fragment27,421,"For a man whom Rebecca West , a contemporary Balkan observer , called ‰Û÷ M_repulsive ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ treacherous ‰Ûª for deserting his Serbian son-in-law , King Alexander , M_in the First World War , it is a M_sepia-tinted M_view of history ."
a1g-fragment27,422,"Nicholas was known as ‰Û÷ the M_uncle of Europe ‰Ûª for his success M_in marrying his beautiful but penniless daughters M_into the grander royal houses of Russia , Serbia and Italy ."
a1g-fragment27,423,M_This furthered his long-term ambition to M_rule a large ‰Û÷ south Slav ‰Ûª kingdom when the Ottoman Empire finally M_collapsed .
a1g-fragment27,424,"One daughter , a grand duchess of Russia , even gained a M_footnote M_in history by introducing an unknown monk , Rasputin , M_to the Russian Tsarina Alexandra ."
a1g-fragment27,425,"In his minute , inaccessible capital , which today M_has only 15,000 inhabitants , Nicholas erected a miniature European court and an exquisitely furnished Victorian palace ."
a1g-fragment27,426,He even persuaded 12 European M_powers to M_turn cottages M_into full embassies .
a1g-fragment27,427,It was a M_fair achievement in a town which an earlier observer described as ‰Û÷ 44 hovels ‰Ûª .
a1g-fragment27,428,"But Nicholas 's grand M_design M_collapsed M_in 1918 when his Serbian son-in-law , Alexander , deposed him and incorporated Montenegro M_into Yugoslavia ."
a1h-fragment05,69,Obituary : Virgil Thomson
a1h-fragment05,70,By PETER DICKINSON
a1h-fragment05,71,"VIRGIL THOMSON was a composer and writer of originality , courage and wit M_formed by a unique M_mixture of American and French influences ."
a1h-fragment05,72,"Thomson was born in Kansas City M_in 1896 , M_studied at Harvard , and then mostly lived in Paris M_until 1940 ."
a1h-fragment05,73,"His Missouri childhood M_gave him M_access M_to Baptist hymns and church music , but at Harvard he was M_introduced M_to the writings of Gertrude Stein and the music of Erik Satie ."
a1h-fragment05,74,M_These influences M_laid the M_foundations for the M_blend of the naive and the sophisticated which is the M_hallmark of Thomson 's maturity .
a1h-fragment05,75,"Like many young American composers he M_studied M_with Nadia Boulanger , but M_after 1925 M_set M_out to achieve the ‰Û÷ discipline of spontaneity ‰Ûª which he M_found M_in Stein 's writings ."
a1h-fragment05,76,When he collaborated M_directly with her M_in opera the result was of M_historical significance .
a1h-fragment05,77,"First M_came Four Saints M_in Three Acts , produced M_in 1934 , and then The Mother of Us All ( 1947 ) , which M_demonstrated a new kind of M_plotless opera only now M_reaching a M_wider M_currency M_through the stage works of Philip Glass ."
a1h-fragment05,78,"M_In Four Saints Thomson 's informality was M_given M_free M_reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then , when it M_stuck , wrote it down M_to a M_figured bass ."
a1h-fragment05,79,He said : ‰Û÷ I had wondered whether a M_piece so M_drenched M_in Anglican chant ( M_running M_from Gilbert and Sullivan M_to Morning Prayer and M_back ) could M_rise and M_sail . ‰Ûª
a1h-fragment05,80,"But the resulting M_mixture of hymns , folksy tunes and recitatives ‰ÛÓ M_at times of M_intoxicating banality ‰ÛÓ was a M_sensation ."
a1h-fragment05,81,"The opera , like Gershwin 's Porgy and Bess the following year , M_used an all-Black M_cast and the staging and choreography M_gave it a British M_connection since it was by Frederick Ashton ."
a1h-fragment05,82,"The Mother of Us All M_shows more continuity , but again much depends M_upon production M_in what is still a largely non-narrative opera ."
a1h-fragment05,83,"M_In 1936 , three years M_before Aaron Copland , Thomson started writing film M_scores which were a M_model of unobtrusive M_clarity and pertinence , combining American M_materials to M_suit documentaries such as The Plow that M_Broke the Plains and The River M_with the musique d'ameublement M_approach of Satie ."
a1h-fragment05,84,His M_score for the film Louisiana Story was M_awarded the Pulitzer Prize M_in 1948 .
a1h-fragment05,85,Another response M_to a visual stimulus was Thomson 's series of musical M_portraits of people such as Picasso and Aaron Copland .
a1h-fragment05,86,The first of M_these was written M_in 1928 and they number M_about 150 .
a1h-fragment05,87,"Just as Thomson M_transferred Stein 's literary abstraction M_to music , so M_these M_portraits unusually M_employ the M_painter 's M_technique of M_drawing the M_sitter M_from life : an ideal combination of Thomson 's M_habit of M_immediate response M_with an actual M_subject ."
a1h-fragment05,88,"The results are M_terse and sharply M_etched , like the best M_line M_drawings ."
a1h-fragment05,89,Thomson could M_control words M_with the same fastidiousness as notes .
a1h-fragment05,90,"He always M_felt that effective musical criticism M_began by being well written , and he never M_lost his liveliness ."
a1h-fragment05,91,One never quite knew what he was going to say next .
a1h-fragment05,92,"He started by writing occasional articles but M_in 1939 he wrote The State of Music , a trenchant and provocative M_assessment of the M_machinery of the musical profession M_at the time ."
a1h-fragment05,93,M_From 1940 M_to 1954 he wrote regularly for the New York Herald Tribune and four volumes of his M_notices have M_appeared M_in book M_form .
a1h-fragment05,94,"He wrote a fulsome 400-page autobiography , characteristically entitled Virgil Thomson M_on Virgil Thomson , and a personal survey , American Music since 1910 , M_appeared M_in 1972 , M_followed recently by a selected edition of his letters ."
a1h-fragment05,95,As both composer and critic he M_touched both M_sides of the M_coin : A M_climate of receptivity is what the artist most desires .
a1h-fragment05,96,It is also a M_thing that even the most experienced reviewer can not always offer .
a1h-fragment05,97,Thomson 's judgements M_about music were not always as accurate as his confident expression implied : he M_invited discussion .
a1h-fragment05,98,M_Above all he M_restored the M_focus of music criticism M_onto the music itself .
a1h-fragment05,99,"He M_made no secret of his Francophile enthusiasms , M_in M_reaction M_to the earlier domination of American music by Germans , and he was one of the first writers to M_register the importance of jazz ."
a1h-fragment05,100,"He fearlessly M_attacked convention , which caused problems when he M_pitched M_into established reputations ."
a1h-fragment05,101,It has become increasingly apparent that Thomson M_belonged M_to the American experimental tradition .
a1h-fragment05,102,"He anticipated some of the enthusiasms of John Cage , whom he first met M_in 1941 ."
a1h-fragment05,103,"A few years later Thomson M_recognised Cage as ‰Û÷ the most original composer in America , if not the world ‰Û_ ‰Ûª and Cage M_repaid the compliment by writing the works M_section of a monograph M_on Thomson ."

a1h-fragment06,114,Obituary : Thomas Keller
a1h-fragment06,115,By HUGH MATHESON
a1h-fragment06,116,THOMI KELLER is the M_outstanding figure M_in the history of international rowing .
a1h-fragment06,117,"He was President of FISA ( Federation Internationale des Societes d'Aviron ) , the world governing M_body , for 30 years ; and most of M_this M_body 's M_attitudes and M_practices M_reflect the M_force of his strict , but genial personality ."
a1h-fragment06,118,"Most athletes first encountered him as a voice , M_bellowing M_in multi-lingual fury M_at officials who had M_broken rules or M_arrangements M_designed to M_make racing safer or more M_fair ."
a1h-fragment06,119,He was elected to succeed Gaston Mullegg as President of FISA when he was 33 and still competing in the Swiss rowing team .
a1h-fragment06,120,He did not M_loosen his M_links M_with the athletes when M_projected M_upwards M_into the Presidency .
a1h-fragment06,121,"Provided their behaviour was sportsmanlike and safe , oarsmen M_found only encouragement and humour M_from a President who was always among them ."
a1h-fragment06,122,"Keller 's Zurich upbringing M_made him M_into a skiier and sculler , and he raced for the Grasshopper club ."
a1h-fragment06,123,He competed for the Swiss cross-country and ski-jumping team at the Student Winter Games and later concentrated M_on single sculls .
a1h-fragment06,124,"M_In 1950 , he was Swiss sculls champion and finished third M_in the European championships M_before moving to Manila to work for his family 's private multinational company , Eduard Keller Ltd , for four years ."
a1h-fragment06,125,"M_On his return , Keller was Swiss champion again M_in 1955 and was bitterly disappointed when the Swiss chose to boycott the 1956 Olympics M_after the Russian intervention in Hungary ."
a1h-fragment06,126,FISA was then a relatively unimportant M_body which M_organised European and other championships and M_participated M_in the M_running of Olympic regattas .
a1h-fragment06,127,"As a rich , forceful young man , Keller had been M_earmarked as a likely future president , even before Mullegg was killed M_in an aircrash M_in 1958 ."
a1h-fragment06,128,Rowing was transformed M_in the M_breadth and M_depth of participation M_over the 30 years of his term .
a1h-fragment06,129,He M_sat M_on the appropriate M_boards of the International Olympic Committee and was President of the General Assembly of International Sports Federations for 17 years .
a1h-fragment06,130,M_These M_positions were not M_held for his own M_status but to promote the M_cause of rowing M_where it M_needed clout .
a1h-fragment06,131,"He successfully M_defended rowing as an Olympic sport and M_in 1976 M_introduced women 's events , which have now M_expanded M_to six classes ."
a1h-fragment06,132,His personal preference for sculling M_over rowing M_assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls M_to world championship and Olympic competition .
a1h-fragment06,133,"Keller was M_made a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta M_in 1976 , a time when the proliferation of new M_six-lane , still-water M_courses around the world , which had M_emerged M_under his M_guidance , seemed a M_threat M_to the regatta founded M_in 1829 ."
a1h-fragment06,134,"But it was the M_spirit of Henley , M_with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport , M_presented M_with administrative finesse , which Keller M_took as the M_yardstick for the international M_circuit ."
a1h-fragment06,135,He loved the place and he returned every year to M_play an often small M_part as M_umpire of races M_between undistinguished clubs M_far M_below the Olympic M_standard he was obliged to administer .
a1h-fragment06,136,"He said M_this summer that as he gradually wound down his involvement M_in sport , Henley would be the last M_thing he would give up ."
a1h-fragment06,137,During his term as President of FISA he gradually M_reduced his M_role M_in Eduard Keller Ltd and used the company offices to provide a world M_headquarters for rowing .
a1h-fragment06,138,"The sport is now M_obliged to M_find income M_from the more normal M_sources of television and sponsorship , to M_replace his largely unacknowledged private patronage ."
a1h-fragment06,139,"In spite of his gift M_to the sport , Keller was anxious not to M_abuse his status as President and never went to a rowing event unless invited ."
a1h-fragment06,140,"Because of M_this , he had never seen the Oxford and Cambridge boat race M_until M_this year ."
a1h-fragment06,141,He was enthralled by the entire proceeding and remarked that only the English could M_make a contest M_between two crews which would not M_rank M_in the World 's M_top 10 M_into a M_bigger spectacle than the Olympic final .
a1h-fragment06,142,"The final task he M_set himself for his Presidency , which was due to end next year , was to M_weed M_out M_of the Regatta calendar all the rowing M_courses which could be M_made M_unfair by the wind ."
a1h-fragment06,143,"He had recently travelled from Tasmania to Norway in search of the perfect 2,000 metres of flat water ."
a1h-fragment06,144,"It was a blessing that , in response to congratulations M_on the superb World Championship Regatta at Bled in Yugoslavia three weeks ago , he was able to reply , ‰Û÷ Yes ‰Û_ and best of all , the conditions were M_fair M_throughout ‰Ûª ."
a1j-fragment34,533,The Labour Party Conference : Cook appeals for Labour to M_accept electoral reform
a1j-fragment34,534,By COLIN HUGHES and COLIN BROWN
a1j-fragment34,535,AN IMPASSIONED appeal for Labour to M_back electoral reform was M_made by a M_leading M_Shadow Cabinet M_member yesterday after the national executive M_decided overwhelmingly to M_oppose a proportional representation motion .
a1j-fragment34,536,"Robin Cook , a M_member of the national executive and the health spokesman , said that a Labour government which M_sought to M_force its programme M_on an unwilling nation would be unsocialist ."
a1j-fragment34,537,He told a Labour M_Co-ordinating Committee rally that it was not enough for Labour to win the next election .
a1j-fragment34,538,"It would also be necessary ‰Û÷ to M_smash the M_decrepit , M_effete M_constitution that M_allows a minority to M_capture M_power , and then M_use it ruthlessly M_in the M_interests of the privileged few ‰Ûª ."
a1j-fragment34,539,"Mr Cook argued that 10 years of Thatcherism had been M_forced M_on most people , who had never voted Conservative , and that many of those who opposed PR M_in the Labour Party wanted to use the same undemocratic M_power ‰Û÷ to M_ram socialism M_down the M_throats of a majority who did n't vote for it ‰Ûª ."
a1j-fragment34,540,"Advocates of the first-past-the-post M_system argued that it was the only M_way of M_delivering M_strong government , Mr Cook said ."
a1j-fragment34,541,"But M_after 10 years of Tory rule , he had M_had M_enough of M_that M_approach M_to politics ."
a1j-fragment34,542,"Labour would be M_acquiescing M_in a ‰Û÷ democratic outrage ‰Ûª if it continued M_arguing that , because the Conservatives had M_got away with being undemocratic for so M_long , it was now Labour 's M_turn ."
a1j-fragment34,543,"Mr Cook also countered the argument that PR would M_build M_in a M_pull M_towards the M_centre M_ground , preventing Labour M_from implementing a M_radical programme ."
a1j-fragment34,544,"It seemed strange to M_make M_that argument , Mr Cook said , when it was M_clear the M_whole policy review process was M_designed to placate the M_centre M_ground ."
a1j-fragment34,545,‰Û÷ I can not honestly M_see that a M_system which would require us to compromise the morning M_after the election is really so morally M_inferior M_to a M_system which has already M_obliged us to compromise our policies two years M_before polling day . ‰Ûª
a1j-fragment34,546,"His speech , however , M_came aftera 24-4 vote M_in the national executive to oppose a proportional representation motion which will be debated M_on Thursday ."
a1j-fragment34,547,"The four were Mr Cook , Ken Livingstone , John Evans and Clare Short ."
a1j-fragment34,548,"Mr Livingstone said he was M_against pacts , but 10 years of Thatcherism had M_demonstrated the dangers of M_giving M_power M_to elites ."
a1j-fragment34,549,"However , Neil Kinnock , the Labour leader , and Roy Hattersley , his deputy , both opposed the motion ."
a1j-fragment34,550,"Mr Hattersley said M_giving disproportionate M_power M_to small , minority M_centre parties would not improve democracy ."
a1j-fragment34,551,Mr Kinnock said it was wrong to propose a fundamental change M_in the voting M_system for a short-term M_tactical vote to M_get M_rid of the Thatcher Government .
a1j-fragment34,552,The only M_way to M_remove the Government was for Labour to win the next general election .
a1j-fragment34,553,Mr Kinnock intends to M_reinforce his M_conviction that Labour is M_in a M_position to win M_in his keynote speech tomorrow .
a1j-fragment34,554,"Party organisers want the conference to M_show that the party is united as never M_before , M_leaving Mr Kinnock M_free for the first time to M_sell the policy M_package M_to voters M_without worrying M_about M_splits ."
a1j-fragment34,555,"There is expected to be a M_close vote M_on defence , but Mr Kinnock is confident the new policy will be affirmed today ."
a1j-fragment34,556,The executive is M_recommending rejection of a motion M_calling for unilateral disarmament .
a1j-fragment34,557,"It is also M_urging the conference to M_oppose a motion , M_supported by the National Union of Mineworkers , to M_commit a Labour government M_to abolishing all nuclear M_power M_within 15 years ."
a1j-fragment34,558,There could also be controversy M_over the executive 's M_rejection of demands for the age of consent for homosexuals to be M_reduced M_to 16 years .
a1k-fragment02,28,PUB ROCK / M_Pint-sized rock ‰Û÷ n ‰Ûª M_rollers : Jim White selects the best of the London pub venues and gigs M_in the weeks M_ahead
a1k-fragment02,29,By JIM WHITE
a1k-fragment02,30,GENERAL TIPS A general M_rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer ( except at Finsbury Park 's Sir George Robey where an excellent music policy M_comes M_complete with a M_decent pint of Guinness ) .
a1k-fragment02,31,"Another M_rule of M_thumb is that if the act is M_obliged to M_rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage , it will be a good evening ."
a1k-fragment02,32,"There are two types of pub rock occasions : M_those , like the one described M_above , M_where the band is likely to suffer M_from agrophobia ; and M_those M_where the pub is so crowded , death M_through asphixiation seems to be the only M_way to get out ."

a1l-fragment01,1,Ripping yarns and M_moral M_minefields : Allan and Janet talk Ahlberg talk M_to Celia Dodd M_about their bestsellers for children
a1l-fragment01,2,By CELIA DODD
a1l-fragment01,3,"M_THESE days , no one questions the importance of good books for the M_under-fives ."
a1l-fragment01,4,"But books that M_appeal M_to adults too are just as important ; we are , M_after all , the ones who have to do the reading ."
a1l-fragment01,5,There are few M_things worse than being M_bludgeoned M_into reading a book you hate .
a1l-fragment01,6,"Story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood , a real M_meeting of adult and child minds ."
a1l-fragment01,7,"M_With the Ahlbergs ' books , it very often is ."
a1l-fragment01,8,"The husband-and-wife partnership M_behind such classics as The Jolly Postman , Burglar Bill and The Baby 's Catalogue M_win children M_over M_with ripping yarns and a M_wicked sense of humour ."
a1l-fragment01,9,They win their parents over with a M_rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly M_reassuring .
a1l-fragment01,10,Their books are usually M_set nostalgically M_in the past ‰ÛÓ the Thirties and Forties are favourite periods ‰ÛÓ and often feature the M_perennial M_characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes .
a1l-fragment01,11,Yet they are M_saved M_from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures .
a1l-fragment01,12,"The Ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the M_harsh realities of life , of being too cosy and M_sweet , but their latest picture book , Bye Bye Baby , published today , M_breaks the M_mould ."
a1l-fragment01,13,"M_In it , a small child roams the streets , talking M_to strangers , until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram ."
a1l-fragment01,14,"M_Curious subject matter for a children 's picture book , you might think , and hardly guaranteed to M_win the approval of the M_gimlet-eyed children 's book M_world ."
a1l-fragment01,15,But the Ahlbergs M_have no time for literal interpretations of their work .
a1l-fragment01,16,"How , they argue , would Alice , or The Wind in the Willows , M_stand M_up M_against such scrutiny ?"
a1l-fragment01,17,"The M_way to M_look M_at Bye Bye Baby , they insist , is as a ‰Û÷ M_light , surreal comedy ‰Ûª ."
a1l-fragment01,18,"‰Û÷ Certainly if you M_bring a literal interpretation M_to the story , it 's a M_minefield , ‰Ûª Allan Ahlberg says ."
a1l-fragment01,19,Bye Bye Baby M_gets M_away M_with its particular M_minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator Janet Ahlberg 's hand .
a1l-fragment01,20,"The visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for Start-rite shoes , M_showing a small boy and girl walking off down a M_tree-lined avenue ‰ÛÓ an M_innocent image if ever there was one ."
a1l-fragment01,21,The Ahlberg version features a solitary figure .
a1l-fragment01,22,The advert M_gave the story its vaguely Thirties setting .
a1l-fragment01,23,The success of the Ahlbergs ' working relationship must have a lot to do M_with their M_long and M_happy marriage .
a1l-fragment01,24,"In spite of apparently incompatible personalities ‰ÛÓ she is small and shy , he is large and does most of the talking ‰ÛÓ they M_have an empathy which is essential M_to the M_way they work , a persistent mutual pestering ."
a1l-fragment01,25,"The M_strength of the partnership is M_highlighted for Allan , who also works with a number of other artists ."
a1l-fragment01,26,"The time-consuming M_nature of Janet 's M_part M_in the process , M_combined M_with a bad back which prevents her M_spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day , means she can not keep up with her husband 's M_prolific output ."
a1l-fragment01,27,"‰Û÷ With other illustrators , I work M_at a distance ‰ÛÓ we visit and phone , but there is a M_point M_at which I ca n't pester them any more , ‰Ûª Allan says ."
a1l-fragment01,28,"They M_see themselves not as author and illustrator , M_with separate M_roles , but as a partnership of ‰Û÷ book-makers ‰Ûª , contributing equally M_to the process ."
a1l-fragment01,29,"Allan Ahlberg says : ‰Û÷ M_In the past , a M_lot of children 's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked M_brilliant framed in a gallery , but when you tried to read the book , there was nothing M_there , because the words M_started as a M_coat-hanger to M_hang M_pictures M_on . ‰Ûª"
a1l-fragment01,30,"Given the importance they M_place M_on the interrelationship of words and pictures , the couple 's working lives are surprisingly separate ."
a1l-fragment01,31,"They M_claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work , meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen ."
a1l-fragment01,32,"Their 10-year-old daughter , Jessica , who is likely to be seen with her head M_buried M_in The Beano or a Roald Dahl novel , has provided the inspiration for many of her parents ' books ."
a1l-fragment01,33,"As a baby , she was fascinated by the Mothercare Catalogue , and so The Baby 's Catalogue , which documents the paraphernalia of the infant 's small M_world M_in minute detail , was M_born ."
a1l-fragment01,34,Allan 's experience as a primary school teacher is another M_rich M_source of ideas .
a1l-fragment01,35,"The couple still M_maintain M_close M_links M_with local schools , where they M_spend hours researching , sketching and M_absorbing jokes ."
a1l-fragment01,36,M_After 10 years of teaching Allan had M_had enough .
a1l-fragment01,37,‰Û÷ I M_ran M_out M_of M_steam .
a1l-fragment01,38,It 's a M_killing job .
a1l-fragment01,39,"Little kids M_eat you alive , they want so much physically and emotionally . ‰Ûª"
a1l-fragment01,40,Every year he would have M_half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely read .
a1l-fragment01,41,"He treated reading as a team effort , M_getting them to read the Daily Mirror rather than the dull , babyish books M_on offer ."
a1l-fragment01,42,"M_These days , he writes the books intended to help children learn to read ."
a1l-fragment01,43,‰Û÷ A M_lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories .
a1l-fragment01,44,There 's no reason why they should n't be funny or gripping even if they do n't M_use many words . ‰Ûª
a1l-fragment01,45,"Writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex , as the arbiters of the modern child 's mores ‰ÛÓ librarians , teachers and publishers ‰ÛÓ M_lay M_down ever more stringent criteria ."

a1m-fragment01,1,The M_revolution the countryside needs : Christian Wolmar says Britain is M_lagging M_behind M_in M_setting M_up ‰Û÷ telecottages ‰Ûª
a1m-fragment01,2,By CHRISTIAN WOLMAR
a1m-fragment01,3,THE information technology M_revolution has M_left large swaths of rural Britain M_untouched .
a1m-fragment01,4,The only computers in many villages are M_those owned by the teenage boys of the affluent to play their wham-bam games .
a1m-fragment01,5,"Ashley Dobbs , an engaging young entrepreneur , is M_setting M_out to M_change M_that by creating a nationwide network of ‰Û÷ telecottages ‰Ûª ."
a1m-fragment01,6,"M_This M_clever name , M_with its M_neat evocation of new and old , M_describes a concept which was developed in Sweden and is M_spreading M_to rural areas across the world ."
a1m-fragment01,7,"M_In Mr Dobbs 's words , a telecottage is ‰Û÷ a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work ‰Ûª ."
a1m-fragment01,8,"The equipment consists of , perhaps , four word processors , a modem , a laser printer able to produce artwork-quality output , a fax and a photocopier ."
a1m-fragment01,9,"Software programmes for desk-top publishing , word processing , accounting and business planning are also essential ."
a1m-fragment01,10,"Mr Dobbs , who is chairman of Telecottages UK , warns possible users not to get M_bogged M_down M_with the technology : ‰Û÷ The equipment is a tool to M_overcome what needs to be done ."
a1m-fragment01,11,"People must n't think that because there 's a computer , they 've got to think of a use for it . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,12,"He M_reckons there are no shortages of possible uses ‰ÛÓ farmers can use it to do their accounts , women M_with child-care responsibilities can work M_in their own time on the word processors , publicity M_material for local craftsmen can be M_produced and so on ."
a1m-fragment01,13,"M_This may sound utopian , but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages ."
a1m-fragment01,14,"So M_far M_about 100 have been established , mainly in Scandinavia but also in Japan and several third M_world countries ."
a1m-fragment01,15,"As the network M_expands , so do the uses ."
a1m-fragment01,16,The first was M_opened in the village of Vemdalen in the remote forests of Sweden M_in September 1985 .
a1m-fragment01,17,"The M_impact , according to Henning Albrechsten , president of Telecottages International who has been involved M_in their development since the outset , was M_immediate ."
a1m-fragment01,18,"‰Û÷ By M_holding M_open meetings for children and having the telecottage above the local store , people of all M_walks of life came in - small-scale entrepreneurs and their spouses , shop assistants , craftspeople and children ."
a1m-fragment01,19,"Now , 15 per cent of the village M_regularly M_uses telecottage and at least 20 per cent has M_taken M_courses there . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,20,Britain is M_lagging M_behind .
a1m-fragment01,21,"No telecottages have been established , but there are several initiatives M_in the offing ."
a1m-fragment01,22,The most advanced is a M_plan for five M_in the north of Scotland which will be funded by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and British Telecom .
a1m-fragment01,23,Colin Pavey of British Telecom hopes that they will be M_running M_by the M_end of the year .
a1m-fragment01,24,‰Û÷ Two would be M_business-orientated and three would be community-orientated and located in schools .
a1m-fragment01,25,"We are most interested M_in the idea of networking , M_sharing skills such as translation and using them for distance learning . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,26,Telephone cables in the region are being upgraded to ensure they are M_capable of M_handling faxes .
a1m-fragment01,27,Mr Dobbs 's more unlikely M_allies are the Women 's Institutes .
a1m-fragment01,28,Most of the workers in telecottages and many of the users are women .
a1m-fragment01,29,He says : ‰Û÷ In villages there are many women M_with skills who are n't using them because of child-care problems .
a1m-fragment01,30,But they are interested M_in working .
a1m-fragment01,31,"Users of telecottages are given the key and people can use them M_at any time , which means that women can come in during the evening , early M_in the morning or whatever . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,32,"He is working M_on a scheme M_with the National Federation of WI to organise a competition to celebrate next year 's 75th anniversary by offering 10 telecottages as prizes for its 9,000 M_branches and he is hoping the WI will establish a pilot telecottage near its college in Denman , Oxfordshire ."
a1m-fragment01,33,"While telecottages should become self-financing once established , they do need initial subsidy ."
a1m-fragment01,34,"The cost of providing the start-up equipment is in the order of å£10,000 and Mr Dobbs thinks space is not much of a problem : ‰Û÷ There 's usually the village hall or an empty shop . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,35,Henning Albrechsten M_reckons that it M_takes three years for a telecottage to be M_able to function M_without subsidy .
a1m-fragment01,36,"In Scandinavia , M_with their M_mixed economies , money is always available , M_after a M_bit of persuasion , M_from both local and M_central government ."
a1m-fragment01,37,"In Britain , the M_tight financial regime imposed M_on local councils and the M_reluctance of M_central government to M_take M_on any new expenditure M_makes it necessary to seek funds M_from the private M_sector ."
a1m-fragment01,38,"The only government M_support so M_far has been a recommendation by the Rural Development Commission , M_part of the Department of the Environment , to establish a pilot scheme ."
a1m-fragment01,39,Mr Dobbs sighs : ‰Û÷ M_This is a typically British bureaucratic M_response .
a1m-fragment01,40,It 's been proved elsewhere that they M_work .
a1m-fragment01,41,"We do n't need M_pilots , we need telecottages . ‰Ûª"
a1m-fragment01,42,"As for the private M_sector , while BT may be M_happy to provide M_pump M_priming for five telecottages M_in the north of Scotland , it is not M_about to M_bankroll a nationwide network ."
a1m-fragment01,43,"Nor , it seems , is anyone else ."
a1m-fragment01,44,There is more M_at M_stake M_here than just bringing boxes of M_sophisticated equipment to remote areas .
a1m-fragment01,45,"As Mr Dobbs , who M_runs a country house restoration M_business M_from his home in Micheldever , Hampshire , says : ‰Û÷ Villages are good places to live and work ."
a1m-fragment01,46,The village is a M_fantastic institution and they M_make people happier . ‰Ûª
a1m-fragment01,47,"But the villages are M_dying , becoming suburbs or M_dormitories where few people work but many sleep ."
a1m-fragment01,48,"Employment M_in agriculture , still the main rural industry , M_fell M_from M_over a million M_in the mid-Sixties M_to M_under 100,000 now ."
a1m-fragment01,49,"The M_aim of telecottages is to create well-paid , M_flexible employment which will provide new jobs and M_make existing rural industries more competitive ."
a1m-fragment01,50,The M_emphasis M_on M_high wages is important .
a1m-fragment01,51,"Villages are expensive to live in and if they are to become vibrant communities again , local people must be able to earn enough to be able to continue living in them ."
a1m-fragment01,52,"There is a M_wider M_impact , too ."
a1m-fragment01,53,The abstract M_talk of commuting by rail or road being M_replaced by information technology M_finds a M_concrete expression M_in the idea of telecottages .
a1m-fragment01,54,"Once people M_overcome their fears M_about computers and begin to use them in telecottages , they acquire their own equipment ."
a1m-fragment01,55,Many may eventually be able to work M_from home rather than commute to an office .
a1m-fragment01,56,Henning Albrechsten says : ‰Û÷ Modern information technology has M_given people in remote regions the opportunity to M_overcome their worst M_handicap ; their distance from the M_centres of learning and development . ‰Ûª
a1m-fragment01,57,"He M_sees them as not only M_strengthening small communities , but also as actually beginning to M_reverse the population M_flows from the countryside to the towns ."
a1m-fragment01,58,"Britain , M_with its M_growing traffic problems , seems an ideal place for the onset of M_this M_revolution ."
a1m-fragment01,59,"Despite Mr Dobbs 's M_tireless efforts , M_this is another M_revolution which Britain is likely to be M_viewing M_from the M_sidelines ."
a1n-fragment09,201,Rugby Union : Welsh M_horizon all turns M_black
a1n-fragment09,202,By STEVE BALE
a1n-fragment09,203,EACH new indignity M_in the M_heap M_visited M_on Welsh rugby seems worse than the last .
a1n-fragment09,204,The selectors knew they were M_playing M_with M_fire when they decided to M_arrange a M_couple of club M_fixtures and they have duly been M_consumed M_in a M_conflagration of their own M_making .
a1n-fragment09,205,"The New Zealanders , appropriately garbed in funereal black , arrive next week to M_scatter the M_ashes ."
a1n-fragment09,206,On and off the field the national game of the Land of Song is M_in a M_discordant M_mess .
a1n-fragment09,207,M_Losing was one M_thing but to M_lose as M_spinelessly as the Welsh XV did M_to Bridgend M_on Saturday was to M_add insult M_to severely M_injured pride .
a1n-fragment09,208,"‰Û÷ M_In all honesty we should have won M_by at least 15 M_points , ‰Ûª Brian Nicholas , the Bridgend M_coach , said ."
a1n-fragment09,209,"As if 24-17 and derisive M_chants of ‰Û÷ Easy , easy ‰Ûª were not bad enough , M_this humiliation was M_against a M_side who have M_made a M_wretched start M_to the season ‰ÛÓ a week earlier Pontypool had M_given them a 35-6 M_going-over ‰ÛÓ and were M_short of at least M_half-a-dozen first-choice players ."
a1n-fragment09,210,Four of the absentees suffered the M_squirming M_discomfort of being among the Welsh M_squad .
a1n-fragment09,211,"‰Û÷ It 's not that I do n't want to say anything but I just do n't know what to say , ‰Ûª John Ryan , the Welsh M_coach , sighed ."
a1n-fragment09,212,"His M_plans M_in M_ruins , he is now M_reduced , M_Micawber-like , M_to hoping something will M_turn M_up before his players M_face the All Blacks M_in five M_short weeks ."
a1n-fragment09,213,"At Bridgend he looked M_in despair , and he almost M_admitted as much : ‰Û÷ I hope we can pull it together but sometimes I M_have my doubts . ‰Ûª"
a1n-fragment09,214,Nicholas was sympathetic : ‰Û÷ He is only as good as the players we M_give him . ‰Ûª
a1n-fragment09,215,"But another selector confided the truth that Wales should be M_giving club opposition a M_hammering ‰ÛÓ and M_at M_half-time , M_building M_on their win M_over Newbridge , it M_looked as if they would ."
a1n-fragment09,216,"They had M_weathered Bridgend 's early M_fury , M_conceding a try M_before M_coming M_back M_with some confidence to M_score three of their own ."
a1n-fragment09,217,But Wales were M_having us M_on .
a1n-fragment09,218,M_From the comparative opulence of 17-6 they then M_slipped M_into M_penury by conceding 18 M_unanswered M_points .
a1n-fragment09,219,Bridgend M_raised their game M_against Wales ; now Wales must do precisely the same M_against New Zealand .
a1n-fragment09,220,No one who was at the Brewery Field ( perhaps not even the selectors ) would M_give M_twopence for their ability to do so .
a1n-fragment09,221,The M_backs were mainly M_pedestrian but the fundamental problem M_lay M_elsewhere .
a1n-fragment09,222,"Apart from Kevin Moseley 's M_steady M_supply M_from the line-out , there was nothing much to M_commend M_in a Welsh forward effort which M_reverted M_to the very worst Eighties stereotype of static , cumbersome M_donkeys only too willing to slow the game M_to walking pace ."
a1n-fragment09,223,"‰Û÷ When the M_pressure M_comes M_on , players revert M_to bad M_habits , ‰Ûª Ryan said ."
a1n-fragment09,224,"The All Blacks would treat such an outmoded M_approach M_with the scorn it M_deserves , although M_on the other M_hand they might have been impressed M_with Bridgend 's contrasting M_mobility and M_aggression ."
a1n-fragment09,225,"The back row were M_swifter M_to the M_loose ball , M_had a M_clearer idea of what to do with it when they got M_there , and their impressive half-backs were M_given every opportunity ‰ÛÓ which they eagerly M_took ‰ÛÓ to M_control the game ."
a1n-fragment09,226,M_This was conveniently M_encapsulated M_in the first try .
a1n-fragment09,227,"Wales , characteristically , M_delayed the heel M_at a scrum , M_putting Robert Jones M_in trouble when the ball finally emerged ."
a1n-fragment09,228,"He was scragged by Mike Budd , Jeremy Cooper came away with the ball , Owain Williams acted as the M_link , and Kevin Ellis M_scored : three back-row forwards and their M_scrum-half M_in perfect M_harmony ."
a1n-fragment09,229,"Wales 's instant M_reaction , a try by Arthur Emyr , and subsequent M_steady improvement , M_bringing M_well-crafted tries for Emyr and Robert Jones , M_promised more than was later fulfilled ."
a1n-fragment09,230,"M_In the third M_quarter Bridgend M_had little difficulty M_in M_wiping M_out an M_11-point deficit , Huw Bevan M_supporting Aled Williams 's M_break for their second try ."
a1n-fragment09,231,It was a magnificent fightback and such was Welsh M_distress that they never looked like preventing it .
a1n-fragment09,232,"‰Û÷ We have M_taken a M_step M_backward , ‰Ûª Ryan said ‰ÛÓ and M_on M_this M_sorry evidence it M_looks as if it will be M_backwards all the M_way when the Test M_takes M_place at Cardiff Arms Park M_on 4 November ."
a1n-fragment09,233,"As the Welsh squad do not meet again M_until 30 October , time has all but M_run M_out ."
a1n-fragment18,335,Football : Hazard M_hints M_at the missing M_gifts
a1n-fragment18,336,By PATRICK BARCLAY
a1n-fragment18,337,HOW TO describe Saturday 's match M_between Chelsea and Arsenal ?
a1n-fragment18,338,"Well , I seem to M_recall a London gallery M_exhibiting a pile of rubbish , which was M_considered M_valid art by the proprietors and M_drew a M_large attendance ."
a1n-fragment18,339,"The only M_redeeming feature of a goalless , worthless event at Stamford Bridge was that it did not require a grant ."
a1n-fragment18,340,"Yet the Chelsea manager , Bobby Campbell , and Arsenal assistant , Theo Foley , agreed it had been a good match , and the spectators ' complaints were M_muted ."
a1n-fragment18,341,Some even applauded the players M_at the M_end .
a1n-fragment18,342,It M_takes all sorts .
a1n-fragment18,343,"Bobby Robson was there to M_assess World Cup candidates , but nothing positive M_emerged M_from 90 minutes of M_scuffling that M_made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of Rangers ' European Cup M_exit in Munich three days earlier ."
a1n-fragment18,344,At least the outcome was appropriate .
a1n-fragment18,345,"Had either of the teams M_won , they would have M_taken the League M_leadership ."
a1n-fragment18,346,Instead Liverpool M_stayed M_top M_without kicking a ball .
a1n-fragment18,347,"Television had M_postponed Manchester United 's scheduled M_visit to Anfield so it could be shown M_live M_on 22 December , the M_longest night ."
a1n-fragment18,348,"London 's M_leading pair , as if M_piqued by M_this , M_turned 30 September M_into the M_longest afternoon ."
a1n-fragment18,349,M_On and M_on it M_dragged .
a1n-fragment18,350,"Lacking a goal that might have altered its M_chemistry , it remained a matter of M_dull M_physics ."
a1n-fragment18,351,"Yet many of the crowd were M_kept interested by the possibility of victory , which is , I suppose , what derbies are M_about ."
a1n-fragment18,352,"They are so frequent M_these days in London , which M_has eight of 20 First Division clubs , that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden ."
a1n-fragment18,353,"Why , though , could M_these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the M_fine M_passing that had M_sprinkled the previous weekend 's Merseyside M_joust ?"
a1n-fragment18,354,"The M_simple M_answer is that Chelsea are M_in a false M_position and Arsenal , M_on M_this evidence , slightly jaded champions ."
a1n-fragment18,355,"They ought to have M_pocketed three M_points M_in the first M_half-hour but Tony Adams , a more threatening centre-forward M_on his M_forays than the current Alan Smith , missed the target M_with two headers and David Rocastle let Dave Beasant M_save a penalty , much as the M_stretch-version M_keeper had done for Wimbledon M_in the 1988 FA Cup final ."
a1n-fragment18,356,Now an Arsenal team M_in M_peak M_health would have M_kept a M_grip M_on the match .
a1n-fragment18,357,M_This one could not .
a1n-fragment18,358,"As George Graham M_indicated M_upon his M_side 's M_accession M_to the M_title , they would need more composure and sophistication to match Liverpool M_in the M_longer term ."
a1n-fragment18,359,He chose not to hasten the process by buying .
a1n-fragment18,360,"M_After all , he M_had just the man M_on his staff ."
a1n-fragment18,361,But Paul Davis remains unfit .
a1n-fragment18,362,"His absence is increasingly conspicuous and Liverpool , for the moment , M_in a super league of one ."
a1n-fragment18,363,"Davis , of course , would have M_walked M_into England 's team in Poland a week M_on Wednesday ; M_until last season 's prolonged M_suspension , M_followed by injury , Bobby Robson M_had him M_firmly pencilled in as Bryan Robson 's replacement ."
a1n-fragment18,364,"Michael Thomas , several years younger , is not quite M_in the same M_class yet but may have to play in Chorzow ."
a1n-fragment18,365,"If so , it will be a gamble , because he M_flopped M_on his only previous international appearance in Saudi Arabia ."
a1n-fragment18,366,"The odds are favourable enough according to Chelsea 's Mike Hazard , who said of his adversary : ‰Û÷ He could cope in Poland , not just because of his ability to M_close people M_down and use the ball well , but temperament ‰ÛÓ you M_saw when he scored the goal that M_won Arsenal the League . ‰Ûª"
a1n-fragment18,367,"Very kind , but international players are supposed to be habitually influential , and it was Hazard who M_in the second M_half , M_with a few incisive passes , M_gifts M_from the M_heavens M_on a day like M_this , M_left a M_greater M_mark ."
a1n-fragment18,368,Chelsea might have M_won had the ball not M_kept M_turning M_into a Mexican M_bean at Kerry Dixon 's feet .
a1n-fragment18,369,"Campbell 's M_hard-working M_side are still M_trying to M_sort M_out their M_system , which involves a M_spare defender and , as M_far as one can M_see , a good M_deal of improvisation ."
a1n-fragment18,370,"It should M_suit Tony Dorigo , the unblooded England M_left-back , though oddly his rival , Nigel Winterburn , did more rampaging M_on Saturday ; neither , M_in truth , M_made the M_heart M_pound ."
a1n-fragment18,371,Dorigo at least M_had the satisfaction of seeing his M_direct opponent and England colleague David Rocastle M_withdrawn .
a1n-fragment18,372,"All M_in all , Bobby Robson must have M_found it M_about as M_fruitful as a day trying to M_get in touch with Brian Clough ."
a1n-fragment18,373,"There was , however , one M_aspect that M_deserves commendation ."
a1n-fragment18,374,"M_After 16 minutes Graham Roberts was injured by a tackle for which Perry Groves was booked ( Steve Clarke took over as M_sweeper , and is likely to M_have several weeks M_in which to M_build M_on a promising M_display ) ."
a1n-fragment18,375,"Roberts 's ankle appeared broken , but the Chelsea players were not interested M_in retribution and the club , as soon as they M_knew the injury was less M_serious , M_put a message on the electronic scoreboard : an example of public relations M_from which others could learn ."
a1p-fragment01,1,Pope rejects Runcie 's M_vision of church leadership
a1p-fragment01,2,"M_From ANDREW BROWN , Religious Affairs Correspondent , in Rome"
a1p-fragment01,3,"THE ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury , Dr Robert Runcie , M_exchanged a symbolic kiss of peace with Pope John Paul II yesterday M_at a mass attended by thousands in St Peter 's Square , Rome ."
a1p-fragment01,4,"But Dr Runcie 's ideas of a limited primacy ‰ÛÓ recognising the Pope as a M_central figure M_in the Christian Church , who would M_exercise ‰Û÷ a primacy for the sake of unity and mission ‰Ûª ‰ÛÓ have been rejected as insufficient by the Pope ."
a1p-fragment01,5,"They have also M_aroused Protestant anger M_against Dr Runcie , M_at the same time as he has become involved M_in a row M_over his M_attack M_on the ‰Û÷ M_Pharisees ‰Ûª of British society ."
a1p-fragment01,6,"Though Dr Runcie and his party could not M_take Holy Communion M_at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been M_dogged by protests M_from supporters of the Rev Ian Paisley ."
a1p-fragment01,7,"M_In his sermon , Dr Runcie said : ‰Û÷ We should ever recognise the scandal that Anglicans and Roman Catholics must celebrate two eucharists to M_make one memorial of our redemption M_on the day of our M_Lord . ‰Ûª"
a1p-fragment01,8,Dr Runcie has M_gone M_out M_of his M_way M_on M_this visit to concede many of the doctrinal M_points and practices which M_large M_elements of the Church of England have traditionally M_found offensive M_in Roman Catholicism .
a1p-fragment01,9,"The Pope , too , has spoken M_warmly of unity ."
a1p-fragment01,10,"M_On Saturday the two prelates attended a M_service of vespers at the Church of San Gregorio , which M_stands on the site where Pope Gregory sent St Augustine of Canterbury off to become the first Archbishop of Canterbury M_in 597 ."
a1p-fragment01,11,But M_in their prepared homilies the Pope and the Archbishop M_addressed quite different problems .
a1p-fragment01,12,"Dr Runcie repeated his offer of a limited primacy , involving the limited M_powers M_exercised by the popes M_in the first few centuries of the Christian Church ."
a1p-fragment01,13,"However , the Pope 's M_account of the M_role of the papacy M_went a great deal M_farther than M_that : Christian unity , he said , must be M_founded M_on the faith M_in Christ that was M_handed M_on by the Apostles ; what M_this faith is must be determined by the Roman Catholic Church ."
a1p-fragment01,14,He quoted the Second Vatican Council : ‰Û÷ The task of M_giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God ‰Û_ has been entrusted M_to the living M_teachting office of the Church M_alone .
a1p-fragment01,15,"The specific M_role of bishops which is to be M_exercised M_in M_communion M_with the M_see of Peter M_in ensuring the unity and continuity of the faith is M_vital if we are to M_hand M_on the faith of Peter , Gregory and Augustine ."
a1p-fragment01,16,All our efforts to M_restore unity among Christians will be in vain if they are not carried out M_in total fidelity M_to the faith M_in Christ ‰Û_ M_handed M_on by the Apostles . ‰Ûª
a1p-fragment01,17,M_In a statement afterwards Dr Runcie M_stressed that he was not proposing any M_change M_in the British M_constitution .
a1p-fragment01,18,‰Û÷ The phrase ‰Û÷ universal primacy ‰Ûª M_has a spiritual meaning .
a1p-fragment01,19,"It does not imply political supremacy , and does not suggest that the Pope should administer the affairs of the Church of England , ‰Ûª he said ."
a1p-fragment01,20,Both prelates referred M_to the consecration M_in February of the Rt Rev Barbara Harris as the Anglican Assistant Bishop of Massachussetts .
a1p-fragment01,21,Bishop Harris is quite unacceptable M_to the Vatican .

a1p-fragment03,62,"He conceded that there would be disputes M_with colleagues , but said : ‰Û÷ There are no M_quick M_fixes , and I will not be indulging M_in any M_quick M_fix ."

a1x-fragment04,164,By OLIVIA TIMBS
a1x-fragment04,165,FADS for vitamin supplements have been M_overtaken by a vogue for minerals and M_trace elements .
a1x-fragment04,166,"Zinc is the latest : lack of it supposedly causes a M_range of problems , although little scientific evidence M_supports the M_link ."
a1x-fragment04,167,"But some reports have M_suggested that M_low zinc M_levels may M_lead M_to problems M_in pregnancy , M_from difficult labour M_to congenital malformations M_in children ."
a1x-fragment04,168,There is M_stronger evidence that a zinc deficiency may cause the foetus to grow slowly in the womb .
a1x-fragment04,169,Doctors in Bristol decided to test the theory .
a1x-fragment04,170,"M_In a study of nearly 500 women , they M_found that zinc supplements did not improve either foetal health or M_reduce the number of pre-term labours ."
a1x-fragment04,171,The doctors conclude M_in the British Medical Journal that there would be little benefit if all women in the UK were given zinc supplements during pregnancy .
a1x-fragment04,172,"They M_recognise , however , that the women M_in their study were largely middle-class , who might well have sufficiently M_large zinc M_stores because they were well nourished ."
a1x-fragment04,173,"Further studies , the researchers believe , should M_concentrate M_on pregnant women known to M_have a zinc deficiency or to be M_at risk M_from problems during labour ."

a1x-fragment05,176,RENEE HENRY underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer .
a1x-fragment05,177,"Dr Maurice Slevin , a consultant physician M_at the M_department of medical oncology at St Bartholomew 's Hospital , London , said the chances of a woman being alive and well four years M_after such treatment were at least 75 per cent ."
a1x-fragment05,178,"Mrs Henry refused the drug treatment M_given to M_reduce the chances of a relapse , but there are many who would remain well M_without it , Dr Slevin said ."
a1x-fragment05,179,M_Part of the M_attraction of alternative cancer treatments such as the Gerson therapy is that they M_allow a patient to M_feel more M_in M_control of the treatment .
a1x-fragment05,180,"Dr Slevin agreed that M_this is often beneficial , but is concerned M_about other M_aspects of such therapies ."
a1x-fragment05,181,"Very few have been evaluated , and the evidence is largely anecdotal , he said ."
a1x-fragment05,182,Some of the treatments M_have M_dramatic side-effects .
a1x-fragment05,183,"‰Û÷ If they do M_work , M_that is wonderful ‰ÛÓ but we M_have no M_way of knowing for sure ."

a2d-fragment05,32,"The TV western seemed to M_fade M_into the M_sunset some time M_in the mid-1970s , M_victim of a M_narcissistic age that M_preferred to M_look at M_prosperous , M_smart-alecky or M_violent images of itself ( Dallas , Cheers , Miami Vice ) ."
a2d-fragment05,33,It was a time when children were encouraged to fantasize M_about machines and M_outer space rather than marvel M_at the open spaces where the deer and buffalo roamed .
a2d-fragment05,34,"Now , however , it seems , the M_wheel has M_turned M_full M_circle ."
a2d-fragment05,35,"The western is being M_revived , M_reinterpreted for the 1990s ."
a2d-fragment05,36,"One of the most successful Hollywood TV producers , David Jacobs , the creator of Dallas , believes the western also M_fell M_victim M_to late 1960s iconoclasm ."
a2d-fragment05,37,"‰Û÷ The John Wayne stereotype was rejected , along with his conservative M_values , ‰Ûª he said ."
a2d-fragment05,38,"A series of spoof or obsessively realistic 1960s westerns ( Cat Balou , Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , Soldier Blue , The Wild Bunch ) M_stripped the M_mask from the Lone Ranger 's face ."
a2d-fragment05,39,"The legend could not be M_taken seriously any longer M_in what had been , admittedly , a M_threadbare M_form ."

a2d-fragment05,45,We knew that the US Government had M_signed 453 treaties M_with the Indians and M_broken every one .
a2d-fragment05,46,A M_part of the myth just did n't M_work M_after M_that . ‰Ûª
a2d-fragment05,47,"M_At their M_peak M_in the mid-60s , there were 39 western series M_on the three American TV networks ‰ÛÓ almost two a day M_on each M_channel ."
a2d-fragment05,48,"M_In the US weekly audience ratings M_in 1965 , there were three westerns M_in the M_top five , and seven M_in the M_top 10 ."
a2d-fragment05,49,M_By the mid-80s they had all M_gone the M_way of the buffalo : M_extinct save for M_preservation in the M_national M_park of permanent re-runs .
a2d-fragment05,50,"Gene Autry , the first TV cowboy , now 82 , says westerns M_dominated the early days of TV partly because they had lively , cheaply produced visuals , but mainly because early TV was M_starved of feature films by the studios ."
a2d-fragment05,51,Westerns were a M_handy M_substitute .
a2d-fragment05,52,"There are encouraging M_signs , however , that the TV western is M_struggling M_back M_into the M_saddle ."
a2d-fragment05,53,"Paradise , M_launched M_on CBS last season and M_shown M_on BBC1 M_this summer , was the first new western serial for a decade ."
a2d-fragment05,54,"It was the only new drama series M_in US network TV to be M_allowed a second series M_this year , despite a relatively M_lowly 49th ranking M_in the ratings ."
a2d-fragment05,55,"Its creator and executive producer is , perhaps surprisingly , David Jacobs ."

a2d-fragment05,57,‰Û÷ I believed the genre was still an important and M_powerful one .

a2d-fragment05,63,It also M_says a lot M_about modern American TV .
a2d-fragment05,64,"Because the networks M_believe westerns M_appeal mainly M_to middle-aged men , Young Riders M_has a M_cast of five pouting young male actors , M_in an attempt to M_make a western M_with ‰Û÷ good demographics ‰Ûª ."
a2d-fragment05,65,The effect is rather like an M_extended M_advertisement for M_Marlboro M_Lights .
a2d-fragment05,66,Westerns are no longer a cheap option .
a2d-fragment05,67,"The classic western TV series were filmed in back-lots , or in the semi-desert 20 miles from Los Angeles ."
a2d-fragment05,68,"Modern audiences no longer accept plastic bushes , and the southern Californian suburban M_sprawl means the production companies have to M_take their horses and cows to locations far away in Arizona or Montana ."
a2d-fragment05,69,David Jacobs also M_points M_out that the cost of hiring a stage-coach is now prohibitive .

a2d-fragment05,75,"Westerns , by their M_nature , M_demand more time on location ."
a2d-fragment05,76,"As a result , Mr Jacobs says , it cost nearly as much to M_make an episode of Paradise , with relatively unknown actors , as an episode of Dallas , with its M_big M_stars ."
a2d-fragment05,77,Will the western M_ride again ?
a2d-fragment05,78,John Mantley is cautious .

a38-fragment01,1,"Motoring : A lead-free M_lover 's M_guide M_to used cars : Drivers M_with a M_tight budget and an environmental conscience can buy second-hand M_without M_losing principles , says James Ruppert"
a38-fragment01,2,By JAMES RUPPERT
a38-fragment01,3,"M_FROM M_this month , all new cars submitted for British type approval , the test which M_allows M_them to be legally sold in the UK , must be M_able to M_run M_on lead-free petrol ."
a38-fragment01,4,"As a result of M_this M_rule , and many carefully M_orchestrated publicity M_campaigns , the motor industry 's M_image has now changed M_from polluter M_to M_pal of the earth ."
a38-fragment01,5,"If you can afford an environmentally friendly G-registered runabout , then the flora , fauna and children of the British Isles will M_have a lot to thank you for ."
a38-fragment01,6,"But if you M_have a M_tight budget and a conscience , running older cars M_on lead-free fuel becomes a much more M_complicated issue ."
a38-fragment01,7,"M_Without the presence of a lead compound , an engine 's valve M_seats go M_unprotected ."
a38-fragment01,8,M_This M_leads M_to premature wear and M_plumes of blue smoke M_spewing from the exhaust .
a38-fragment01,9,"The only effective M_remedy is to install hardened valve M_seats or a replacement cylinder M_head , both expensive options ."
a38-fragment01,10,"Less costly , but not entirely satisfactory , is the practice of M_making every fourth tankful leaded petrol , which protects the valve M_seats but rather M_defeats the M_object ."
a38-fragment01,11,"Alternatively there are several chemical additives M_on the M_market which M_aim to provide a substitute for lead , although the case for M_these products has yet to be proved ."
a38-fragment01,12,"However , many cars built M_within the last few years M_have hardened valve M_seats , or alloy cylinder M_heads that M_need little ( simply a M_retune ) or no modification to use unleaded petrol ."
a38-fragment01,13,Finding out which cars can and which can not is not difficult .
a38-fragment01,14,"Esso filling stations M_have a M_free booklet M_listing most models produced since 1980 , as M_does the charity Clear ( 01-387 4970 ) , M_with more detail available M_in the Unleaded Petrol Guide ( Autodale , å£2.99 ) ."
a38-fragment01,15,Looking at M_those lists provides interesting reading and bears out the used-car trade 's M_view that having a lead-only car could prove to be a liability .
a38-fragment01,16,"It is not as if four-star leaded fuel is going to be phased out tomorrow , but more and more buyers are asking : ‰Û÷ Does it M_take unleaded ? ‰Ûª"
a38-fragment01,17,"What is certain is that the pre-1989 Austin/MG M_range , all Skodas , Yugos and quite a few Lancias do not , which does not M_help already M_depressed resale prices ."
a38-fragment01,18,"A 1985 Lancia Y10 ( lead only ) sells for M_around å£2,000 whereas the similar Fiat Uno 55 M_from the same year , M_converted to M_run M_on unleaded , is worth M_around å£500 more ."
a38-fragment01,19,A lead-only second-hand car is now worth M_about 10 per cent less than an unleaded equivalent .
a38-fragment01,20,M_In years to M_come the percentage difference is likely to be much M_larger .
a38-fragment01,21,"Even so , exotica such as lead-only Porsche 911s and Ferraris are unlikely to be M_part of M_this trend , so no bargains M_there I 'm afraid ."
a38-fragment01,22,More impressive are the Japanese manufacturers whose cars dating M_from the early Eighties can M_run M_on unleaded M_without adjustment .
a38-fragment01,23,"Find a 1980 Toyota Corolla or 1982 Nissan Sunny that has not M_succumbed M_to rust , and you can buy M_with confidence ."
a38-fragment01,24,"M_On the home M_front , most Fords and Vauxhalls M_from at least the mid-Eighties can use unleaded ."
a38-fragment01,25,"If the ‰Û÷ M_greenness ‰Ûª of going unleaded still seems a M_bit of a M_grey M_area , it is possible to switch M_to diesel M_without a M_shadow of environmental doubt ."
a38-fragment01,26,"Diesel always has been lead-free and the only M_adjustments you need to M_make are mental M_ones , because diesel-powered cars are no longer slow , smelly or noisy ."
a38-fragment01,27,"They also M_return more miles M_to the gallon than their petrol equivalents , although service M_intervals are M_shorter ."
a38-fragment01,28,But M_after the publicity M_on unleaded fuel there has been increased interest M_in used diesel power .
a38-fragment01,29,"But remember that M_these cars accrue , and can withstand , significantly M_higher mileages than petrol cars , 50-90,000 being the norm ."
a38-fragment01,30,The tradition for diesel cars is M_far better established on the Continent and M_that is where the best buys M_come from .
a38-fragment01,31,"Perhaps the most M_successful maker is Peugeot , M_with a complete M_range of cars M_from the small 205 ‰ÛÓ M_around å£3,000 for a 90,000-mile 1985 car ‰ÛÓ M_to the legendary 504 estate , M_about å£2,000 for a 1982 example ."
a38-fragment01,32,"The Germans are also fairly accomplished manufacturers , although a five-door 1980 Golf M_with a six-figure mileage will still cost å£1,500 ."
a38-fragment01,33,"Prestige M_comes M_in the M_shape of a Mercedes M_with the 240D or ‰Û÷ Stuttgart Taxi ‰Ûª , M_commanding å£7,000 but M_returning unfailing reliability ."
a38-fragment01,34,"Even if lead M_levels in the atmosphere do not bother you , I am sure you will M_find the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaper , and that diesel fuel M_boosts mpg M_by at least a third , most interesting ."

a3c-fragment05,188,By MICHAEL JACKSON
a3c-fragment05,189,THANK God it 's Saturday .
a3c-fragment05,190,"I know that today is Saturday because already I am thirsty for a M_dry , hoppy pint of bitter M_at the M_end of the afternoon : an aperitif to M_sharpen my appetite for M_this evening 's Indian meal ."
a3c-fragment05,191,How did you M_feel as you M_came M_to the M_end of your working week yesterday afternoon ?
a3c-fragment05,192,"Boy , I M_had a thirst ."
a3c-fragment05,193,"We say we are thirsty when we mean that we fancy a glass of wine , a pint of beer , a gin and tonic or a M_shot of whisky ‰ÛÓ the pleasure of naming our M_poison ‰ÛÓ M_at the M_end of a M_busy day or tiresome week ."
a3c-fragment05,194,M_That is not thirst .
a3c-fragment05,195,"To enjoy it , we do not need to be M_dry : just in need of a restorative or relaxant , or maybe a M_focus for a social moment or M_brief encounter ."
a3c-fragment05,196,We call it ‰Û÷ thirst ‰Ûª in lieu of a more M_accurate description .
a3c-fragment05,197,"No , not more M_accurate : ‰Û÷ thirst ‰Ûª is not M_accurate at all as a description for M_this apparently indescribable condition ."
a3c-fragment05,198,"It is a desire millions of us know and M_share , yet for which we M_have no name ."
a3c-fragment05,199,"M_This desire that can not M_find its name ( though it would M_dare M_speak it , if it could ) is pleasurable ."
a3c-fragment05,200,It is as enjoyable as M_feeling M_gently hungry or M_amorous .
a3c-fragment05,201,"No , not amorous : M_randy ‰ÛÓ we M_have a word for M_that ."
a3c-fragment05,202,Any of M_these conditions is pleasurable so long as there is a good likelihood of satisfaction M_in reasonably M_short M_order .
a3c-fragment05,203,"Let M_puritans and pessimists damn , disapprove or M_dismiss M_these M_appetites ; M_that is their M_loss ."
a3c-fragment05,204,"M_Those of us who enjoy them need only a name for each condition , so that we may discuss them M_in expectation and M_in recollection ."
a3c-fragment05,205,"M_Come to think of it , neither hunger nor randiness M_hits quite the M_spot ."
a3c-fragment05,206,"Peckishness and lust , perhaps ?"
a3c-fragment05,207,Or does M_that sound like a M_firm of M_country M_solicitors ?
a3c-fragment05,208,M_This is to digress .
a3c-fragment05,209,What of M_this thirst that can be M_satisfied by an M_unquenching drink ?
a3c-fragment05,210,"Wine is not M_quenching , but no less M_in demand for M_that ."
a3c-fragment05,211,"Try to M_quench your thirst with a M_light , fresh white and you will drink enough to M_put you M_on your M_back ."
a3c-fragment05,212,"Beer is , quite rightly , Britain 's favourite Friday night drink ."
a3c-fragment05,213,"It can momentarily M_blunt a thirst , but not altogether M_cut it ."
a3c-fragment05,214,The M_nearest M_to being M_quenching is the ‰Û÷ white ‰Ûª beer of Berlin .
a3c-fragment05,215,Anything with even a M_modest M_smack of hops M_dries the palate M_ready for the M_next one .
a3c-fragment05,216,"So , of course , does alcohol itself ."
a3c-fragment05,217,"It may for a moment seem to M_quench but it dehydrates , as purportedly healthy abstainers are forever telling me ."
a3c-fragment05,218,"To M_quench is more than to refresh although our M_lying , M_lascivious eyes M_tell us the two are the same ."
a3c-fragment05,219,"Does any drink look more M_quenching than one of M_those Italian or French patent aperitifs , M_swirling M_in a refractive pink or russet M_oiliness , M_clothing the melting ice : a Campari , Dubonnet , Lillet or ( too rare in this country ) a Picon ?"
a3c-fragment05,220,Are they M_quenching ?
a3c-fragment05,221,"No , refreshing ."
a3c-fragment05,222,"In Strasburg , they have been known to M_lace beer M_with Picon , thereby ruining both drinks ( as Queen Victoria reputedly did with claret and malt whisky ) , but still the result is not especially M_quenching ."
a3c-fragment05,223,"Perhaps a shimmering M_dry Martini cocktail ( minimum dilution , stirred , not shaken ; and served M_straight M_up ) looks even more refreshing , though its effect is M_that of a M_silver M_mallet ."
a3c-fragment05,224,"In the right place ( possibly New York , but San Francisco is better ) , the Martini is the ultimate ‰Û÷ Thank God it 's Friday ‰Ûª drink ."
a3c-fragment05,225,"The requirement for such pleasures is a matter of time and place , and it does not have to be Friday , Berlin or Strasburg , New York or San Francisco ."
a3c-fragment05,226,"Not feeling thirsty , but fancying a drink , M_has a M_world of moments ."
a3c-fragment05,227,Some Frenchmen start the day with a coffee and calvados .
a3c-fragment05,228,The people of Munich call their version of Weissbier ‰Û÷ breakfast beer ‰Ûª and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages .

a3c-fragment05,230,"If the moment is M_before a lunch on the plane , it really ought to be a Bloody Mary ."
a3c-fragment05,231,"If it is at an elegant dinner table , there is a choice M_between a fino sherry ( or a manzanilla ) or champagne ."
a3c-fragment05,232,None of M_these requires anything even M_approaching a thirst .
a3c-fragment05,233,Do we really ‰Û÷ M_wash M_down ‰Ûª a good meal with claret ?
a3c-fragment05,234,Port is immediately M_suggested by Stilton ; cognac by coffee .
a3c-fragment05,235,"I do not fully appreciate the experience of an American late-night movie without a bourbon , or a book M_at bedtime without a single malt ."
a3c-fragment05,236,M_These are not moments of thirst ‰Û_ but nor are they causes of drunkenness ( unless one tries to M_pack all such experiences M_into one day ) .
a3c-fragment05,237,We do not drink because we are thirsty .
a3c-fragment05,238,"Nor , if we are M_in civilised M_cast of mind , because we wish to become drunk ."
a3c-fragment05,239,"A friend of mine says that her body M_tells her , M_without being M_asked , the season of the year ."

a3c-fragment05,241,"If it were only a matter of alcohol , would a body M_care ?"
a3c-fragment05,242,People will nevertheless say that the desire is for nothing more than alcohol .
a3c-fragment05,243,So why not a pill or an injection ?
a3c-fragment05,244,"Because there would be no colour , no M_ritual , no time and place , no glorious variety ."
a3c-fragment05,245,"Worst of all , there would be no aroma , taste , texture or finish ."
a3c-fragment05,246,"M_These are sensuous pleasures M_at their most enjoyable when we M_ritualise them , but how do we M_feel when we desire them ?"
a3c-fragment05,247,"We , who M_have so many words M_in our language , M_have none for M_this ."

a3e-fragment03,23,"In the Garden : M_Planning to M_beat a leafy M_retreat at home : M_In the first of a series for M_novice gardeners , Anna Pavord M_stresses the M_value of careful forethought"
a3e-fragment03,24,By ANNA PAVORD
a3e-fragment03,25,PLANTS should M_come a M_long M_way M_down the M_list of priorities for the M_novice gardener .
a3e-fragment03,26,There are many M_things to think M_about M_before even the first tentative daffodil bulb is M_sunk into the ground .
a3e-fragment03,27,The first and most important question to mull over as you gaze at your patch is : What is M_this garden for ?
a3e-fragment03,28,"If you start writing down some of the responses M_to M_that question , you will M_find you have M_along the M_way acquired a M_ragbag of M_elements that will M_have an important M_bearing M_on the design ."
a3e-fragment03,29,"If there are small children M_in the M_equation , there will need to be a flat , soft area where they can fall off swings and climbing frames ."
a3e-fragment03,30,"If you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the M_bowels of an expensive machine , you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it ."
a3e-fragment03,31,"Some M_novice gardeners may not want to do much actual gardening at all , but conversely , do not want to look out every day over a scene of M_threadbare grass and rotting fence ."
a3e-fragment03,32,Their ideal garden will look good and M_demand little attention .
a3e-fragment03,33,"If you are a dedicated sun-worshipper , you need to M_mark M_out the part of the garden where the sun M_lingers longest ."
a3e-fragment03,34,"It may not be the part nearest the house , though M_this is where sitting out areas always tend to be made ."
a3e-fragment03,35,"You may , even as a M_novice , care so passionately M_about plants that all you want is the maximum space to grow them in ."
a3e-fragment03,36,Raised M_beds built M_down an unpromising alley could provide extra gardening space .
a3e-fragment03,37,Privacy is an important consideration .
a3e-fragment03,38,A first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one I am imagining for M_this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses .
a3e-fragment03,39,Privacy is a M_ticklish business M_where M_close neighbours are concerned .
a3e-fragment03,40,To throw up an impenetrable M_Berlin M_Wall between you and them could be tactless .
a3e-fragment03,41,Trellis is a useful compromise and you can always pretend it was M_forced M_on you by the speed of growth of your M_climbing rose .
a3e-fragment03,42,Aesthetes M_among the M_novices will by now be thoroughly irritable and complaining that gardens should have as much to do M_with the soul as M_with the necessity or not of a washing line or a barbecue pit .
a3e-fragment03,43,"So they should , and when the list of necessities is securely written down , you can ask the second question : How do I want M_this garden to M_feel ?"
a3e-fragment03,44,M_This question M_produces as varied a response as the first .
a3e-fragment03,45,"Some urban gardeners , as M_short of space inside as they are out , want their gardens to be extensions of their homes , M_with a M_great M_deal of hard paving , good furniture and lighting ."
a3e-fragment03,46,"The garden for them should M_feel like an extra sitting room , gnat-ridden perhaps , damp occasionally , but an important M_overflow of living space ."
a3e-fragment03,47,Closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some Sussex meadow and M_picture it M_swagged with honeysuckle and M_waving with M_ox-eye daisies and scabious .
a3e-fragment03,48,M_This is a difficult trick to bring off M_with suburban trains hurtling by on one side and lorries M_grinding M_through their gears on the other .
a3e-fragment03,49,"A leafy M_retreat is an excellent M_goal for a small town garden , but it is best made acknowledging the urban setting , using un-wild plants such as bamboo , acanthus , fig , vine , alchemilla , euphorbia , wisteria ."
a3e-fragment03,50,"While you are working M_through M_this process , M_take M_note of the features in the garden that you would like to keep ."
a3e-fragment03,51,"On a new estate , there may be nothing ."
a3e-fragment03,52,"In an M_old garden , there may be a fruit tree , or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that , tidied up , could M_add a dash of M_venerability M_to the new garden that will M_emerge around it ."
a3e-fragment03,53,"If you do not know what a tree or shrub is , M_exercise clemency and M_give it a year 's grace to demonstrate its M_worth before you M_turn it M_over M_to the axeman ."
a3e-fragment03,54,The M_mood of the garden will M_dictate its eventual style .
a3e-fragment03,55,"It may be clipped classical , random cottage , modern high-tech , or some intensely personal M_vision of Byzantium , that no one has ever imagined M_before , but which exists M_in your head and M_wants to M_get M_out ."
a3e-fragment03,56,"Do not let anybody , particularly gardening writers , M_tread M_on your M_dreams ."
a3e-fragment03,57,"All M_this thinking and doodling will have done nothing physically to change the view outside the window , but it is a M_vital M_part of the gardening process ."
a3e-fragment03,58,"Before you can make , you have to know what it is you are making ."
a3k-fragment11,109,"Property : Houses that are M_going , M_going , M_gone : Fed up M_with trying to sell , more people are auctioning their home instead ."
a3k-fragment11,110,Andrew Bibby reports
a3k-fragment11,111,By ANDREW BIBBY
a3k-fragment11,112,"IN THE small Devon town of South Molton , Julie Widlake is waiting M_with anticipation for Friday 20 October ."
a3k-fragment11,113,"She and her boyfriend have M_had their future M_planned for some time : they want to start farming in a nearby village , where they also intend to build a bungalow ."
a3k-fragment11,114,"First , they have to sell their present house , a two-bedroom cottage in the centre of the town ."
a3k-fragment11,115,"As is the case almost everywhere else , the M_market in Devon is M_depressed and selling has not been easy ."
a3k-fragment11,116,"So instead of waiting indefinitely for a buyer , they have decided to try selling their house by auction ."
a3k-fragment11,117,"It M_comes M_under the M_hammer M_at 2.15pm M_on the 20th , at the Barnstaple Motel ."
a3k-fragment11,118,"‰Û÷ We accept that we might not get very much for it , but M_on the other M_hand we could get more , ‰Ûª says Julie Widlake ."
a3k-fragment11,119,"‰Û÷ We 've been waiting to move for a M_long time , and we need the money to build the new house . ‰Ûª"
a3k-fragment11,120,"Their South Molton cottage ( M_guide price å£44,000-å£46,000 ) is one of more than 20 lots to be M_put M_up for sale M_at the Barnstaple auction by Bristol and West Property Services , and one of more than a hundred which the building society subsidiary will be auctioning in eight West Country venues M_over a three-day period ."
a3k-fragment11,121,"Bristol and West M_claims M_these auctions will M_help to M_bring some M_action M_to an otherwise M_slow M_market , and M_says it was M_overwhelmed by the M_response M_from people wanting to sell M_in M_this M_way ."
a3k-fragment11,122,Auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process .
a3k-fragment11,123,"Once the M_hammer has M_fallen , the successful bidder for a house must exchange contracts immediately and pay a deposit ."
a3k-fragment11,124,Completion normally M_takes M_place four M_to eight weeks later and there is no opportunity for second thoughts .
a3k-fragment11,125,"As the Bristol and West M_explains , if a bidder does not sign the contract , the auctioneer can sign M_on their behalf ."
a3k-fragment11,126,"‰Û÷ M_From the vendor 's M_point of M_view , the house is actually sold once a successful bid is M_made , ‰Ûª says Graham Harrison , director of Bristol and West Property Services ."
a3k-fragment11,127,"‰Û÷ Many people have suffered M_from sales falling through and M_from house-buying M_chains , and some of our vendors M_feel that now 's as good a time as any to sell . ‰Ûª"
a3k-fragment11,128,"M_From the purchasers ' M_point of M_view , auctions can also be M_attractive ‰ÛÓ if slightly nerve-racking as you wait for bidding to start for the house of your M_dreams ."
a3k-fragment11,129,"The problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking M_surveys and M_arranging mortgage finance , M_without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price ."
a3k-fragment11,130,"Not surprisingly , several estate agents report difficulties M_at the moment M_in M_attracting enough serious bidders ."
a3k-fragment11,131,"‰Û÷ M_With an auction , you 've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can M_commit themselves , and the difficulty is that buyers who can M_proceed are few and M_far M_between , ‰Ûª said David Phillip , a director of Yorkshire estate agents Dacre Son and Hartley ."
a3k-fragment11,132,Bristol and West M_hopes that by M_arranging collective auctions it will be M_able to overcome M_this problem .
a3k-fragment11,133,"It is also guaranteeing mortgages M_at 1 per cent M_below the normal interest rate , for endowment or M_pension-linked policies , M_on several of the houses M_up for sale , an interesting and innovative service for would-be bidders ( mortgage M_surveys will already have been undertaken for M_these houses ) ."
a3k-fragment11,134,"The building society will be M_staffing a mortgage desk M_at each auction , and M_says buyers could M_arrange finance M_there and M_then , subject of course M_to proof of income and status ."
a3k-fragment11,135,"Obviously , however , Bristol and West M_hopes to hear M_from interested people M_in M_advance ‰ÛÓ if only so it can M_gauge the likely demand for each property before the auction starts ."
a3k-fragment11,136,"‰Û÷ We 're trying to M_smooth the M_path for purchasers , and M_streamline the M_system , ‰Ûª says Graham Harrison , M_pointing M_out that M_live telephone bidding will also be available for M_those unable to attend ."
a3k-fragment11,137,Holiday homes and commercial property have been M_included M_among the lots to be auctioned .
a3k-fragment11,138,"Although collective property auctions M_take M_place regularly in London ( often primarily for investors rather than M_house-hunters ) , in country areas the more typical auction will be just for one house , and as likely as not will M_take M_place in a nearby pub or village hall ."
a3k-fragment11,139,"M_In fact , country auctions are often the M_nearest many villages M_get M_to M_live M_theatre ."
a3k-fragment11,140,"‰Û÷ The locals come for the entertainment , and to see who 's buying M_into their village , ‰Ûª observed one auction-goer ."
a3k-fragment11,141,Pub landlords are usually only too happy to provide M_free accommodation .
a3k-fragment11,142,"‰Û÷ It 's very exciting and M_gets the adrenalin M_going , ‰Ûª says David Phillip , whose firm usually M_undertakes auctions in the Otley area ."
a3k-fragment11,143,"Only certain types of property normally M_come M_to auction , however ."
a3k-fragment11,144,"Traditionally , country cottages and houses which M_have unusual or unique M_features or are in need of a M_lot of renovation may be auctioned , if only because valuation is likely to be difficult ."
a3k-fragment11,145,"Sometimes , too , houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors ( auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold M_at the going M_market value , and M_protect trustees M_from future claims of negligence ) ."
a3k-fragment11,146,"Less happily , but for the same reason , repossessed houses are often auctioned ."
a3k-fragment11,147,Anyone M_considering selling by auction needs to be aware that the costs involved will be M_higher .
a3k-fragment11,148,"Advertising costs and any expenses incurred M_in hiring premises are normally M_passed M_on by the estate agents M_to the vendor , whether or not the auction results M_in a sale ."
a3k-fragment11,149,"In addition , agents may M_charge slightly more commission than usual for a M_successful sale ."
a3k-fragment11,150,"In Bristol and West 's forthcoming auctions , a set fee of å£375 plus VAT will be M_charged M_to everyone M_entering property to sell , M_with its usual agent 's M_commission ( M_about 2 per cent plus VAT ) M_charged M_on M_top when sales are M_made ."
a3k-fragment11,151,"‰Û÷ We accept that we could M_lose the money we 've paid to M_go M_to auction , but M_that 's a risk we 're M_prepared to M_take , ‰Ûª says Julie Widlake ."
a3k-fragment11,152,"The secret of a successful outcome depends partly M_on M_setting the right reserve price , a task the auctioneer undertakes in conjunction with the seller ."
a3k-fragment11,153,"Normally , the reserve is M_set only days or hours M_before the auction , when the agents will already M_have a good indication of how much interest has been M_shown ."
a3k-fragment11,154,"Too M_high a reserve price can mean no sale , and disappointment all M_round ."
a3k-fragment11,155,"‰Û÷ You need to understand what your clients ‰Ûª expectations are beforehand , ‰Ûª says Graham Harrison of Bristol and West ."
a3k-fragment11,156,Agents and their clients may also M_have the dilemma of deciding whether to accept any offers M_made prior to the auction .
a3k-fragment11,157,Inevitably they do not always M_get it right .
a3k-fragment11,158,"Peter Crowther , managing director of a Leeds business M_centre , recently bought two semi-detached stone cottages in Bramhope , on the outskirts of Leeds , M_at an auction in the village pub ."
a3k-fragment11,159,"His successful bid was for å£190,000 although he had M_made a M_higher prior offer which had been M_turned M_down ."
a3k-fragment11,160,"M_On the other M_hand , sometimes the M_drama of the auction and the competition M_between bidders can M_have the M_opposite effect ."
a3k-fragment11,161,"Another recent auction in Leeds M_saw a run-down stone farmhouse without water or other amenities finally M_fall M_under the M_hammer for å£330,500 ."
a3k-fragment11,162,"‰Û÷ Success is by no means guaranteed M_at auction , ‰Ûª says Graham Harrison ."
a3k-fragment11,163,"‰Û÷ M_In a M_tough M_market you need to M_get the programme right , the price right and M_have a little M_bit of luck . ‰Ûª"

a3p-fragment09,161,"M_UNTIL six or seven years ago , outsiders M_associated East Anglia M_with fens , flatness and the vanished Edwardian nannies of Frinton ."
a3p-fragment09,162,"Its old churches , green fields and long beaches were cherished by the inhabitants of Essex , Suffolk , Norfolk and Cambridgeshire , but not yet M_on the tourist agenda ."
a3p-fragment09,163,"Today , I was told , villagers living around the great wool churches of Lavenham and Long Melford have to bar their doors and ignore the knocking of tourists , who M_take them for antique shops and offer to buy their furniture ."
a3p-fragment09,164,The tourists are right .

a3p-fragment09,168,"Yet you only have to read Ronald Blythe 's Akenfield to realise that M_these picturesque , half-timbered cottages , often painted the characteristic Essex pink ( pale salmon ) , ochre or spring-leaf green , are more prosperous now than ever M_in the ‰Û÷ real ‰Ûª past ."
a3p-fragment09,169,"Many are still elaborately decorated with pargeting , an ornate , patterned plasterwork practised in M_this area since the early thirteenth century ."

a4d-fragment02,71,"A M_prayer for the brick M_cathedral facing St Paul 's : Bankside Power Station is a masterpiece M_worth , preserving , Gavin Stamp argues"
a4d-fragment02,72,By GAVIN STAMP
a4d-fragment02,73,"FROM the top of the dome of St Paul 's Cathedral the view is no longer M_dominated by City church steeples but by an intrusive M_cacophony of drab , characterless Sixties boxes ."
a4d-fragment02,74,One building stands out M_in M_this dispiriting panorama of post-war mediocrity : a M_dark M_powerful mass of brickwork with a tall central tower that M_stands right across the Thames from Wren 's dome .
a4d-fragment02,75,"M_This is not an office block , nor a church ‰ÛÓ although its sublime form might M_suggest that its architect was adept M_at designing cathedrals ."
a4d-fragment02,76,"It is , M_in fact , the now redundant oil-fired electric power station that M_sits on Bankside next to the site of Sam Wanamaker 's new Globe Theatre ."
a4d-fragment02,77,Bankside Power Station should never have been built .
a4d-fragment02,78,"Its architect had M_spent the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the future , M_free of smoke and industry ."
a4d-fragment02,79,"But , when asked M_in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891 , he soon M_forgot such idealism and , like any architect , was glad to M_have the job ."
a4d-fragment02,80,The project was controversial and the power station was only permitted providing the smoke was clean and the building did not M_challenge the visual dominance of St Paul 's .
a4d-fragment02,81,"So the single chimney M_rose only to 325ft , some 45ft below the height of the cross above the cathedral ."
a4d-fragment02,82,"The irony is that had the tower been higher and had the teak ‰Û÷ scrubbers ‰Ûª been less efficient , the smoke would have M_gone straight up into the air ."
a4d-fragment02,83,"As it was , the ‰Û÷ smokeless shimmer of vapour ‰Ûª was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause M_mischief M_with the leadwork on Wren 's great dome ."
a4d-fragment02,84,Bankside Power Station should not have been built .
a4d-fragment02,85,"But , as it was built , it should not now be demolished ."
a4d-fragment02,86,"M_That is because it is a magnificent structure , the supreme architectural expression of the M_heroic , M_monumental phase of power station design and the M_creation of a M_great architect ."
a4d-fragment02,87,"Bankside was the work of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott , OM , the architect of Liverpool 's Anglican Cathedral , the rebuilt House of Commons and some of the last M_vital products of the Gothic Revival ."
a4d-fragment02,88,"He was a designer of extraordinary versatility , being responsible for the standard ‰Û÷ traditional ‰Ûª red telephone kiosk , Waterloo Bridge and several power stations ."
a4d-fragment02,89,Bankside represents the M_fullest realisation of his industrial aesthetic .
a4d-fragment02,90,"Scott 's first venture M_into M_this unlikely M_field of design was at Battersea where , M_in 1930 , he was M_wheeled M_in as a famous knighted architect by the London M_Power Company to try to M_make acceptable the coal-fired monster power station M_to which the residents of Chelsea and Westminster were M_taking M_strong exception ."
a4d-fragment02,91,M_This was a M_brilliant M_move .
a4d-fragment02,92,"Scott was so successful M_in styling the building M_in fine brickwork with ‰Û÷ jazz-modern ‰Ûª fluting ( as John Betjeman called it ) that , when the Battersea ‰Û÷ A ‰Ûª station was M_opened M_in 1934 it was widely acclaimed as a supremely successful modern treatment of a building type that seemed quintessentially twentieth century ."
a4d-fragment02,93,"When , M_in 1939 , The Architects ' Journal M_conducted a M_survey to M_find what were M_considered the best modern buildings in Britain , Battersea was M_placed second ‰ÛÓ and was the favourite of such unlikely celebrities as Sir Kenneth Clark , Rebecca West and Charles Laughton ."
a4d-fragment02,94,"Scott was so pleased M_with the style he had M_evolved at Battersea , a treatment that M_humanised industrial forms M_without denying their function , that he also used it on the Guinness Factory at Park Royal , west London ."
a4d-fragment02,95,"At Battersea , Scott could not alter the basic design of the building and he much disliked the ‰Û÷ M_upturned M_table ‰Ûª appearance created by the four corner chimneys ."
a4d-fragment02,96,"At Bankside , however , he was able to persuade the engineers , Mott , Hay & Anderson , to M_gather all the flues into a single ‰Û÷ M_slender tower or campanile ‰Ûª ."
a4d-fragment02,97,"As a result , he was able to create a symmetrical , monumental composition of M_great M_power ."
a4d-fragment02,98,"As at all his power stations , Scott M_faced the building in a fine Worcestershire brick that has weathered M_to a lovely pinky-brown ."
a4d-fragment02,99,But there is nothing homely M_about the general effect .
a4d-fragment02,100,Vast overlapping planes of brickwork are modelled with careful set-backs and subtle bands of detail .
a4d-fragment02,101,"The result is an expression of the M_monumental aesthetic of the early twentieth century , M_with M_strong American overtones ."
a4d-fragment02,102,"When the campanile is seen from a distance , it seems to belong M_to some strange Expressionist church one has not noticed before ."
a4d-fragment02,103,Not for nothing were such power stations described as ‰Û÷ brick M_cathedrals ‰Ûª ; Bankside is the finest manifestation of M_this tradition .
a4d-fragment02,104,Now it is redundant .
a4d-fragment02,105,Smoke shimmers no longer from the tall tower .
a4d-fragment02,106,"But Bankside is nevertheless a M_sound structure which , like the best mills of the Industrial Revolution , is well M_worth preserving and is perfectly M_capable of adaptation for a new commercial use ."
a4d-fragment02,107,"Such re-use is , of course , much M_encouraged by a building being listed , something which , M_until recently , was not possible M_with architecture of so recent a date ."
a4d-fragment02,108,"Two years ago , however , the Department of the Environment at last M_began the listing of post-war buildings in England that were more than 30 years old ."
a4d-fragment02,109,"Bracken House , the former M_home of the Financial Times , became the first M_candidate and English Heritage then M_submitted some 70 recommendations M_to the Department of the Environment ; these M_included Bankside ."
a4d-fragment02,110,"M_This , however , was too much for the Government and , using the excuse that public opinion was not yet M_ready to M_accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings , Lord Caithness , the Minister of State for the Environment , arbitrarily whittled down English Heritage 's list M_to 18 buildings - excluding Bankside ‰ÛÓ although it represented a more traditional M_approach M_in the Fifties M_to the now-unfashionable Modern M_Movement ."
a4d-fragment02,111,"However , Caithness himself stated that M_this first selection was ‰Û÷ M_in no M_way a definitive list ‰Û_"
a4d-fragment02,112,I M_have no doubt that others will be added .
a4d-fragment02,113,The important M_thing is that the Thirty Year M_Rule is M_in M_force and that we can M_respond M_to developing perceptions of our times . ‰Ûª
a4d-fragment02,114,"Earlier M_this year , M_in my M_capacity as chairman of the Thirties Society , I asked Caithness 's successor , Virginia Bottomley , to reconsider English Heritage 's recommendation of Bankside for listing ."
a4d-fragment02,115,"My argument was that , as Michael Heseltine had so M_boldly listed Battersea Power Station M_in 1980 , it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect ."
a4d-fragment02,116,"Furthermore , the listing of Battersea had ensured the building 's survival for conversion M_to a new use ‰ÛÓ M_in M_that case , as an entertainment M_centre which the Prime Minister herself had M_praised and inaugurated ."
a4d-fragment02,117,"M_After two months ' silence , I was informed that ministers M_stood by their decision ."
a4d-fragment02,118,"I wrote back M_asking the reasons for M_this , M_pointing M_out that , if any large modern power station M_deserved to be listed , it was Bankside ."
a4d-fragment02,119,I have received no satisfactory reply .
a4d-fragment02,120,"Of course , I know perfectly well why the Department of the Environment M_declines to list it ."
a4d-fragment02,121,Listed building procedures might impede the M_full commercial realisation of the site when the electricity industry is privatised .
a4d-fragment02,122,"Furthermore , British Rail M_has its M_eyes M_on the Bankside site for bringing up the spoil from the tunnel for Channel traffic which it is , so absurdly , M_driving under the middle of London M_at M_astronomical cost ."
a4d-fragment02,123,"Listing , M_in theory , is an objective M_assessment of architectural or historical importance which does not necessarily prevent demolition ."
a4d-fragment02,124,"M_In the case of Bankside Power Station , the ultimate ‰Û÷ M_temple of M_power ‰Ûª and a masterpiece of industrial architecture by a major twentieth-century British architect , our historic building M_system is being perverted for purely political reasons ."

a6u-fragment02,165,Oriana Baddeley
a6u-fragment02,166,The 1990s have M_witnessed a shift M_in the art establishment 's M_attitudes M_towards art produced M_outside M_of its traditional parameters .
a6u-fragment02,167,The work of previously marginalised artists has become an M_area of M_rich speculation M_among art dealers priced M_out M_of the ‰Û÷ modern masters ‰Ûª M_market .
a6u-fragment02,168,"Almost every year has M_witnessed the discovery of new artistic M_terrain ‰ÛÓ graffiti art , Soviet art , Australian art , the art of Latin America ."
a6u-fragment02,169,The major auction houses have M_moved M_with the times and have M_found new M_ways of selling works which M_in both form and M_content would have proved an M_unstable investment a decade ago .
a6u-fragment02,170,The current M_status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a M_dramatic example of M_this change .
a6u-fragment02,171,"Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera , her reputation outside of Mexico now M_far supercedes his : since 1919 , sale room estimates of her work have M_risen M_from $40,000 M_to M_over $1 million , and M_in 1990 a work by Kahlo M_broke all records at Sotheby 's New York for a Latin American artist ."
a6u-fragment02,172,The M_enormous M_rise M_in the economic value of her work has developed M_in M_tandem M_with the M_increased critical and popular M_response M_to her particular M_blend of M_naive style and incisive M_content .
a6u-fragment02,173,"While the first M_wave of popular interest M_arose M_with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen , it was the publication of Hayden Herrera 's biography of Kahlo M_in 1983 which has M_led M_to her current cult status ."
a6u-fragment02,174,"Since M_that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries , a feature film ( ‰Û÷ Frida ‰Ûª by Paul Leduc ) , a stage play , numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing ."
a6u-fragment02,175,"M_In May 1989 Elle magazine M_ran a 16 page feature M_on Frida Kahlo as the ‰Û÷ M_spirit of Mexico ‰Ûª ( Fig. 1 ) , while M_in Vogue ( Feb. 1990 ) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‰Û÷ the romance of Frida Kahlo 's Mexico ‰Ûª ( Fig. 2 ) ."
a6u-fragment02,176,"Almost as a logical outcome of M_this media M_blitz , it M_emerged M_in the summer of 1990 that Madonna , already a M_devotee of Kahlo 's work , was commissioning a screenplay M_based M_on Kahlo 's life ."

a6u-fragment02,179,"As M_with most artists who have become M_mythical personalities M_in the popular imagination , such attention has M_focused primarily M_on the anecdotal and M_tragic details of Kahlo 's admittedly fascinating life ."
a6u-fragment02,180,"The passionate obsession M_with her husband Diego Rivera , her flamboyant appearance , but most of all her physical and emotional pain have M_come to M_dominate M_responses M_to her work ."
a6u-fragment02,181,"While Kahlo 's art M_helped her to M_deal M_with the vicissitudes of her life , for most M_audiences it is her life story which M_allows M_access M_to her art ."
a6u-fragment02,182,"M_In M_this one can M_draw obvious M_parallels M_to the M_appeal of Van Gogh , a traditionally popular artist recently M_made fashionable by the media attention M_generated during the centennial of his death ."
a6u-fragment02,183,The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate M_icon for the sixties revival of 1990 'M_s M_long hot summer .
a6u-fragment02,184,"Yet despite the iconic M_status of Van Gogh 's ‰Û÷ M_tragic ‰Ûª life , it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified , his thick impasto brush-stroke , his M_vibrant yellows , the urgency of his creative M_drive ."
a6u-fragment02,185,"M_In the case of Kahlo the popular M_image is of the artist herself , the characteristic brows , the elaborate hair , the Mexican costume ( Fig. 3 ) ."
a6u-fragment02,186,"It is primarily her appearance , not the M_formal M_language of her art , that has M_graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines ."
a6u-fragment02,187,The Elle feature M_transposed the ‰Û÷ Kahlo style ‰Ûª M_to Kahlo lookalikes M_in contemporary clothing M_balanced M_around M_segments of Herrera 's biography of the artist .
a6u-fragment02,188,"M_In the later Vogue M_piece only the style remained as the M_far more overtly sexual , Kahloesque M_models lounged and pouted in their ‰Û÷ Mexican ‰Ûª interiors ."
a6u-fragment02,189,"There is a poignant irony M_in the M_way clothing , which M_on one M_level M_served to hide Kahlo 's M_broken body , falls or is lifted by the M_model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique ( Fig. 4 ) ."
a6u-fragment02,190,The visual references M_in the two magazines are as much M_from photos of the artist as M_from her work .
a6u-fragment02,191,"M_In both features she is also M_seen to embody a M_wider M_set of assumptions M_about Mexico itself ; exotic , passionate , yet constantly M_struggling M_against pain and deceit ."
a6u-fragment02,192,"While Elle , Vogue and subsequently The Independent ( Fig. 5 ) , M_stressed different M_facets of Kahlo 's public persona , they all M_shared the M_emphasis M_on ‰Û÷ her ‰Ûª , as an M_encapsulisation of M_stereotypical M_images of M_Mexico , rather than her work ."
a6u-fragment02,193,"It is her body as the M_canvas , her appearance as M_art ."

a6u-fragment02,199,"Of course , the M_line M_between art and life is a particularly M_hard one to M_draw M_in Kahlo 's case ."
a6u-fragment02,200,The majority of her work is self portraiture ; her aesthetic concerns M_grew M_from her fascination M_with the falsity of appearance .
a6u-fragment02,201,"Dressing up , role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo 's work ."
a6u-fragment02,202,"M_In Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair ( 1944 ) ( Fig. 6 ) , she paints herself wearing Rivera 's suit , M_challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to M_appropriate his authority ( while simultaneously ) threatening castration ) ."
a6u-fragment02,203,"More disturbingly , M_in The M_Mask ( 1945 ) ( Fig. 7 ) , she M_throws doubt M_on too straightforward a M_reading of her self-portraits as M_revealing of her M_inner emotions ."
a6u-fragment02,204,M_Where does the M_mask M_fall : Does not the M_ritual repetition of M_those familiar M_features ‰Û÷ M_mask ‰Ûª far more than it M_uncovers ?
a6u-fragment02,205,"There is , however , an inevitable logic M_to the M_appropriation of her meticulously M_constructed M_image , a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933 : ‰Û÷ ‰Û_ some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‰Û÷ a la Mexicana ‰Ûª , but the M_poor souls only look like M_cabbages and to tell you the M_naked truth they look absolutely impossible . '"
a6u-fragment02,206,"The ‰Û÷ M_impossibility ‰Ûª M_stemmed M_from the failure of such followers to M_recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo 's choice of clothing , a failure also intrinsic M_to her recent magazine appearances ."
a6u-fragment02,207,"The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic , by the generalised M_attractiveness of the radical avant-garde ."
a6u-fragment02,208,"For Kahlo , however , M_choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana , as for example M_in Tree of Hope ( 1946 ) ( Fig. 8 ) , was to embody a M_powerful M_icon of cultural identity ."
a6u-fragment02,209,"Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific , varying M_from region M_to region ."
a6u-fragment02,210,The Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the M_closest M_to pre-Hispanic M_forms of clothing .
a6u-fragment02,211,It is the mythology M_surrounding the women wearers of the costume which M_directed Kahlo 's choice .
a6u-fragment02,212,"The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec M_led M_to the M_adoption of the Tehuana , in post-revolutionary Mexico , as the M_image of the strong Indian woman ; the undefeated counterpart M_to the despised ‰Û÷ Chingada ‰Ûª , who , conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico 's M_hybrid post-conquest culture ."
a6u-fragment02,213,"M_In a culture M_where sexual metaphors are frequently used to M_convey racial and political conflict , the Tehuana M_represents M_that M_aspect of Mexico 's M_indigenous tradition M_unbowed by centuries of colonial and male M_rule ."
a6u-fragment02,214,"Kahlo 's M_adoption of Tehuana dress , while being an M_attractive M_disguise of what she M_saw as a less than perfect body , M_asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist M_position ."

a6u-fragment02,237,"More problematic is the M_way M_in which such a M_dislocation has M_led M_to the acceptance of her ‰Û÷ Mexicanness ‰Ûª as mere M_decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work , thereby M_defusing a substantial M_part of the art described by Breton as a ‰Û÷ M_ribbon M_round a M_bomb ‰Ûª ."

a6u-fragment02,239,"M_In M_this painting , a memorial M_to a woman 's M_tragic death is transformed M_into an M_indictment of the M_culture which M_destroyed her ."
a6u-fragment02,240,Hale 's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive M_nature of the social M_values of New York and North America in general .
a6u-fragment02,241,"The story M_behind Hale 's death was one M_with which Kahlo obviously M_identified , and M_within which dress formed an important symbolic function ."
a6u-fragment02,242,"M_Before jumping from the window of her apartment , Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress , the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer ."
a6u-fragment02,243,"M_In Kahlo 's painting , the figure M_falls M_from the fantasy M_world she has M_inhabited M_to the M_harsh M_bloodspattered reality of the street , literally coming down to earth ."

a6u-fragment02,248,"The painting , dedicated M_to Hale 's mother , was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale , the managing editor of Vanity M_Fair , Clare Boothe Luce ."
a6u-fragment02,249,The painting was agreed M_to by Luce in part to recompense for what she M_saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend .
a6u-fragment02,250,"Having lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to M_discover her spending enormous sums M_on an haute-couture dress , and refused to M_turn M_up to what , M_in retrospect , became Hale 's farewell party ."

a6u-fragment02,253,"M_On one M_level M_this work M_deals M_with a generalised ‰Û÷ woman 's experience ‰Ûª , yet the metaphorical M_power of Dorothy Hale 's dress M_derives M_from Kahlo 's use of clothing M_in her own self-portraits ."

a7s-fragment03,41,THERE was one M_point when the hair on the M_back of my head began to lift .
a7s-fragment03,42,"Not at Paul Hill 's remembrance of beatings M_past , when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots M_running to M_take M_part M_in the fun , and once heard a principal medical officer , no less , telling colleagues : ‰Û÷ Do n't walk his face , do n't walk his face . ‰Ûª"
a7s-fragment03,43,"Not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid , and brought up gasping for breath : ‰Û÷ M_Make him sing God Save the Queen ! ‰Ûª they shouted ."
a7s-fragment03,44,"Brutality , as Hill describes and M_felt it , was a M_bitter M_part of his prison life ; you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could ."
a7s-fragment03,45,But it was Gerry Conlon 's M_account of being interrogated M_after the Guildford bombings that M_made the scalp M_crawl .

a7s-fragment03,49,The M_account he M_gave just M_after his release was that the threat had been that a British soldier might ‰Û÷ accidentally ‰Ûª shoot one of the women .
a7s-fragment03,50,"A few months ago even , M_this would have seemed improbable ."
a7s-fragment03,51,You might have M_assumed M_this was the police M_bluffing and M_bullying .
a7s-fragment03,52,"Yet given what we have learned M_about M_links M_between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland , and the M_deep suspicion M_about surrogate murders , you ca n't M_shrug M_off the shiver Conlon 's words M_bring ."
a7s-fragment03,53,"There were daunting moments M_in last night 's First Tuesday ( Yorkshire ) , but few of them M_matched M_that M_hint of a M_jackboot M_under the M_blue M_serge ."

a7y-fragment03,171,Queen 's Bench Divisional Court Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council v Bujok Before Lord Justice Watkins and Mr Justice Hutchison November 2 1989
a7y-fragment03,172,"IF a dwelling house is M_in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial M_to health or a nuisance , the tenant may M_lay an information M_against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance M_under the Public Health Act 1936 ."
a7y-fragment03,173,The tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to M_give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects M_before commencing legal proceedings .
a7y-fragment03,174,"Although M_that is the M_position M_in law , the court M_emphasised that as a matter of commonM_sense a tenant should first complain M_to the landlord M_before M_exercising the right to prosecute ."
a7y-fragment03,175,The facts .
a7y-fragment03,176,Mrs Bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants .
a7y-fragment03,177,M_In September 1988 Mrs Bujok M_laid an information M_against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance M_under M_section 92(1) of the Public Health Act 1936 .
a7y-fragment03,178,"It was alleged that the council , being the owners of the premises , were the persons by whose act , default or sufferance the nuisance M_arose ."
a7y-fragment03,179,Prior to M_laying the information Mrs Bujok had not M_served an abatement notice M_upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises .
a7y-fragment03,180,The justices M_held Mrs Bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state M_of the property prior to M_laying the information .
a7y-fragment03,181,The council M_appealed by case stated .
a7y-fragment03,182,The legislation .
a7y-fragment03,183,M_Section 92(1) of the 1936 Act M_defines ‰Û÷ statutory nuisances ‰Ûª as ‰Û÷ any premises M_in such a state as to be prejudicial M_to health or a nuisance ‰Ûª .
a7y-fragment03,184,The decision .
a7y-fragment03,185,Mr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily M_envisages a M_system M_where the local authority M_has a M_power and a duty to M_try to M_secure that premises are not M_in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance .
a7y-fragment03,186,M_Action is M_initiated by the M_service of an abatement notice requiring M_remedial work .
a7y-fragment03,187,If the person M_in default fails to comply M_with an abatement notice the local authority is M_obliged to M_make a complaint M_to the magistrates .
a7y-fragment03,188,"If the complaint is proved , a nuisance order is M_made requiring the defendant to M_get the necessary work done ."
a7y-fragment03,189,Effectively the sequence is that the person M_in default is told what is wrong and is required to M_put it right .
a7y-fragment03,190,"He is M_given an opportunity to do so , and if he does not , he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so ."
a7y-fragment03,191,The problem M_arises in connection with M_section 99 which M_adapts or M_applies the provisions M_to cases M_where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to M_make the complaint .
a7y-fragment03,192,Need he M_serve an abatement notice ?
a7y-fragment03,193,The authorities M_plainly establish that he need not and can not do so .
a7y-fragment03,194,Does M_that M_mean he may M_lay an information and M_bring the matter M_before the magistrates M_without first M_putting the person alleged to be M_in default M_on notice of what is alleged ?
a7y-fragment03,195,"The council M_argued that a landlord , particularly one such as a local authority , can not realistically be expected to M_have a M_system of inspection of all its premises and M_in practice is M_entitled to depend M_upon notification by its tenants ."
a7y-fragment03,196,For Mrs Bujok it was argued that the 1936 Act was M_designed to M_secure M_in the M_interests of the M_community at large that statutory nuisances did not exist .
a7y-fragment03,197,"It was submitted that an owner can not M_turn his M_back M_on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting , he knows the property will M_in the M_course of time deteriorate ."
a7y-fragment03,198,He must therefore satisfy himself M_on a M_regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance .
a7y-fragment03,199,"M_In Warner v Lambeth London Borough Council ( 1985 ) 15 HLR 45 , 50 , Lord Justice Glidewell said a private person could M_lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance M_without first M_giving notice requiring abatement ."
a7y-fragment03,200,Therefore M_in the present case the justices M_came M_to the correct conclusion .
a7y-fragment03,201,"His Lordship M_reached M_that decision M_without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common M_sense , notice should be M_given M_in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were M_launched ."
a7y-fragment03,202,Lord Justice Watkins said he agreed M_with reluctance .
a7y-fragment03,203,It was surely repugnant M_to commonM_sense that M_in M_this M_area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants M_without first being M_given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied .
a7y-fragment03,204,M_In law there was no doubt that Mrs Bujok was M_entitled to commence proceedings M_without M_giving notice of the state of the dwelling M_to the council .
a7y-fragment03,205,But M_in every other conceivable M_way M_that M_action was entirely wrong .
a7y-fragment03,206,Endless trouble M_to many people M_in courts and council M_offices and much money could be M_saved by the M_giving of notice of disrepair .
a7y-fragment03,207,"If the council did not M_react M_to M_that notice , then would be the time for the tenant to M_exercise the right to prosecute ."
a7y-fragment03,208,Parliament should M_give M_fresh thought M_to M_enacting a provision M_placing an obligation M_upon a council tenant to M_give notice M_to the council M_before being permitted to commence proceedings .

a8n-fragment19,311,"OLDHAM Athletic , who had never M_beaten a First Division M_side since they M_dropped M_into the Second Division M_in 1923 , made up for 66 years of not M_altogether patient waiting M_with a M_pulsating victory M_over the League champions Arsenal at Boundary Park last night ."
a8n-fragment19,312,The Pennines fairly M_shook .
a8n-fragment19,313,"No supporter of the Latics dared M_dream it , but suddenly the improbable was a M_throbbing , joyous reality ."
a8n-fragment19,314,"Two goals from the irrepressible Andy Ritchie , his 13th and 14th M_this season , and a third by the 20-year-old midfield player Nick Henry , and Arsenal were M_sunk M_with only the M_trace of a last-minute goal by Quinn ."
a8n-fragment19,315,"Despite many and varied M_flurries of activity M_in the first 40 minutes , Arsenal seemed reasonably secure if not inspired ."
a8n-fragment19,316,"They M_held their M_line and competed hard in midfield , M_damping M_down Oldham 's initial verve and M_preparing themselves for more of the same M_in the second half ."
a8n-fragment19,317,Then Oldham M_struck .
a8n-fragment19,318,"Winterburn almost put the ball into his own net from Milligan 's cross , O'Leary M_recovering an awkward M_situation ."
a8n-fragment19,319,Almost immediately Smith M_had an excellent chance for Arsenal but stumbled .
a8n-fragment19,320,"Oldham M_took M_up the M_attack again and Barlow , who M_had a M_fine match at M_left-back , totally M_containing Rocastle , M_floated in a M_deep cross beyond Winterburn ."
a8n-fragment19,321,The M_predatory Ritchie chested the ball down and M_hammered a volley past Lukic .
a8n-fragment19,322,Arsenal M_had no choice but to M_attack as soon as the second half M_began .
a8n-fragment19,323,A M_neat step-over by Rocastle M_sent Thomas hurtling in on goal but Rhodes moved sharply off his line to M_smother the M_shot .
a8n-fragment19,324,"M_From the resulting corner Rhodes M_made another M_fine save , hurtling to his right to deflect away Dixon 's M_rising M_shot ."
a8n-fragment19,325,"Finally , M_with Arsenal M_pressing hard , he M_clawed away Quinn 's M_careful header M_from Thomas 's drag-back ."
a8n-fragment19,326,Quinn held his head M_in disbelief .
a8n-fragment19,327,"Worse , M_far worse was to M_follow ."
a8n-fragment19,328,"Bunn , who M_scored six goals M_in the previous M_round M_against Scarborough , M_this time turned M_into the M_provider , putting Milligan M_clear and free ."

a8n-fragment19,330,"Holden 's 64th-minute free-kick M_clattered the M_wall and the ball fell to Henry , who M_drilled a low M_shot from more than 30 yards M_inside Lukic 's right-hand post ."
a8n-fragment19,331,M_In another 10 minutes any remaining Oldham doubts were dispelled .
a8n-fragment19,332,Ritchie passed to Irwin and then ran M_on to head the cross past Lukic .
a8n-fragment19,333,"Arsenal were M_stitched and M_stuffed , M_with no question of a fluke ."
a8n-fragment19,334,"Not for the first time M_this season their M_defence had been M_found wanting and Oldham M_exploited the weaknesses M_to the M_full , M_owing a special M_debt M_to the inspiration and tireless running of Henry and Milligan ."

a8r-fragment02,21,"Prototyping is crucial M_to systems development , argues Ian Richards M_Tailored to M_fit ."
a8r-fragment02,22,M_IN SYSTEMS development nothing is more fundamental than M_assessing user requirements .
a8r-fragment02,23,If you do n't know what the system is required to M_do ; you do n't know anything .
a8r-fragment02,24,But many system developers are unable to M_assess requirements properly .
a8r-fragment02,25,They seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and M_get an answer that M_amounts M_to a draft system specification .
a8r-fragment02,26,A M_doctor does n't M_ask his M_patient what M_treatment to M_prescribe .
a8r-fragment02,27,The M_patient can M_explain only what the M_problem is .
a8r-fragment02,28,It is the M_doctor that M_provides the M_remedy .
a8r-fragment02,29,If you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be M_met M_with a M_blank look .
a8r-fragment02,30,"A user may M_have a M_deep knowledge of business problems , but knowing little M_about computers , M_has no idea how they should be M_tackled ."
a8r-fragment02,31,"Yet , analysts are heard asking time and again , ‰Û÷ Tell me what you want ."
a8r-fragment02,32,"We 've M_gone M_awayM_from the days of systems M_imposed by the data processing department , M_this is going to be a system for the users . ‰Ûª"
a8r-fragment02,33,"But of course the users do n't know what they want , so they end up getting another duff system ."
a8r-fragment02,34,An effective analyst provides the same M_service M_to the business as the M_doctor M_provides M_to the M_patient .
a8r-fragment02,35,"He finds out what the M_needs of the business are , and M_prescribes the M_cure ."
a8r-fragment02,36,"The user tells the analyst what the problems are , and the analyst decides , at least M_in M_broad M_terms , what the user requires ."
a8r-fragment02,37,But the analyst M_has one M_great advantage M_over the doctor .
a8r-fragment02,38,"Once the user becomes M_familiar M_with the proposed system , M_helpful comments M_come M_thick and M_fast ."
a8r-fragment02,39,"‰Û÷ Oh , M_this will be of M_great help M_in ordering M_raw materials , but sometimes we get part deliveries , could we M_have an extra M_facility to M_deal M_with M_those ?"
a8r-fragment02,40,"And sometimes non-standard discount is M_given , a M_pig to M_deal M_with M_on the old system , but if you could add one extra M_input M_box M_on that screen there ‰Û_"
a8r-fragment02,41,And what M_about orders not delivered M_on time ?
a8r-fragment02,42,If we could list M_those we 'd M_have advance warning of shortage problems M_on the assembly lines two months before they occur .
a8r-fragment02,43,Now M_that would be a M_great M_leap M_forward . ‰Ûª
a8r-fragment02,44,Unfortunately you can not M_reach M_this M_stage M_until you have developed a prototype system .
a8r-fragment02,45,And you ca n't develop a prototype system because the users have n't M_got a M_clue what they want .
a8r-fragment02,46,"Most of them are probably muttering , ‰Û÷ I 'm too busy to get involved M_in this sort of M_thing ."
a8r-fragment02,47,What 's wrong M_with the old system anyway ? ‰Ûª
a8r-fragment02,48,"The only M_way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to M_get M_inside the head of the user and , thinking like a user , decide what sort of system is required ."
a8r-fragment02,49,"Of course , the initial system will not be perfect ."
a8r-fragment02,50,The analyst can not hope to understand the business as well M_in a few weeks as the user does M_after many years .
a8r-fragment02,51,"But once the user M_sees the system , M_channels of communication will M_open ."
a8r-fragment02,52,"Instead of persuading the user to specify requirements , the analyst will be M_driven by the user to M_meet key needs ."
a8r-fragment02,53,Good system development M_goes M_through two M_distinct M_phases .
a8r-fragment02,54,"Initially the analyst does all the work , M_leading the user M_towards a system he thinks is right for the business ."
a8r-fragment02,55,"But once the user M_sees the potential of the system , a M_change M_in M_attitude M_takes M_place ."
a8r-fragment02,56,The process becomes demand driven by the user .
a8r-fragment02,57,"The analyst is then M_forced M_on the M_defensive , explaining why M_new M_features can not be included because they are technically difficult or M_prohibitively expensive ."
a8r-fragment02,58,"Traditionally , systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications ."
a8r-fragment02,59,"M_In theory , validation M_meant that the user had read the specification , imagined how the system would M_work M_in practice , and agreed the M_design ."
a8r-fragment02,60,"It was only when using a ‰Û÷ test ‰Ûª version of the system ( available just M_before the M_planned implementation date ) that difficulties would M_come M_to M_light , and a host of M_change requests be issued ."
a8r-fragment02,61,The advent of fourth M_generation M_languages ( 4GLs ) has M_made system development much easier .
a8r-fragment02,62,M_With a 4GL an initial prototype can be M_put M_together quickly .
a8r-fragment02,63,"This M_means M_feedback is obtained early M_in the development process , and the system can M_grow M_around the user 's requirements ."
a8r-fragment02,64,Crucial M_to the development process is the relationship M_built M_up M_between the analyst and the user .
a8r-fragment02,65,The best systems M_arise when both M_have a M_deep understanding of each other 's jobs .
a8r-fragment02,66,Many developers M_use business analysts to ensure that the development M_team M_maintain a proper M_focus M_on business requirements .
a8r-fragment02,67,"But M_this can be counter-productive , as it M_cuts M_off communication M_between the systems analyst and the user ."
a8r-fragment02,68,Too much specialisation is bad for systems development ; it M_feeds the temptation to get engrossed M_in technical difficulties and forget M_about the M_underlying business needs .
a8r-fragment02,69,"If you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking M_about work , and you can not M_tell one M_from the other , they have probably developed a M_successful system M_together ."

a98-fragment03,51,Edoardo Amaldi .
a98-fragment03,52,Ragazzi M_of distinction : .
a98-fragment03,53,"M_IN December , 1943 , the men working M_feverishly to create the first American atomic bomb sent a M_team of ‰Û÷ M_spooks ‰Ûª to Naples ."
a98-fragment03,54,"One M_of their main assignments was to contact Edoardo Amaldi , a physicist thought to be M_in hiding near Rome ."
a98-fragment03,55,"Six months later , the day M_before Rome 's liberation by the Allies , Amaldi was found ."
a98-fragment03,56,"He was interviewed by Moe Berg , then one M_of the most famous baseball players in America ."
a98-fragment03,57,"Berg was also an agent M_of the Office M_of Strategic Services , which was later to M_give M_birth M_to the CIA ."
a98-fragment03,58,His job was to convince Amaldi to M_pack his M_bags because there was a ship M_waiting at Naples to M_take him to the United States .
a98-fragment03,59,"Amaldi 's presence M_there had been sought by two other Italian colleagues , also physicists ."
a98-fragment03,60,"His mentor , Enrico Fermi , later to be called ‰Û÷ the M_father M_of the bomb ‰Ûª , and Emilio Segre ( who died in California earlier M_this year ) ."
a98-fragment03,61,"Amaldi M_dodged the American invitation , perhaps because ( M_with Rome liberated ) Fermi 's M_mantle M_in physics had M_fallen M_on his M_young M_shoulders and there were M_younger minds to M_teach ."
a98-fragment03,62,He M_wore M_that M_mantle well M_at Rome University M_until his retirement M_in 1978 .
a98-fragment03,63,But Amaldi never really M_retired nor grew old .
a98-fragment03,64,"He M_kept M_regular hours in the university 's physics building , spoke M_at scientific meetings M_this year in Moscow and Washington ."
a98-fragment03,65,As President M_of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei he had M_delivered the welcoming address M_on Tuesday M_to a symposium M_of scientists .
a98-fragment03,66,He then ordered a car to M_call M_for him the M_next morning M_for a similar occasion and was M_felled by a M_stroke while waiting M_for the lift .
a98-fragment03,67,"Amaldi grew up in a small town in Lombardy , and M_took his doctorate M_in physics M_from Rome M_at the remarkably early age M_of 21 ."
a98-fragment03,68,"M_In 1929 , he became one M_of the ragazzi di Via Panisperna ‰ÛÓ the street where Fermi 's ‰Û÷ kids ‰Ûª carried out their own experiments M_under the M_master in their own under-financed lab ."
a98-fragment03,69,"Emilio Segre was one kid , and Bruno Pontecorvo , later to defect from Britain to the Soviet Union , another ."
a98-fragment03,70,"It is interesting to M_note that the ‰Û÷ M_pope ‰Ûª ‰ÛÓ as the kids called Fermi ‰ÛÓ ‰Û÷ because he 's always right ‰Ûª , was only seven years older than Amaldi ."
a98-fragment03,71,"Amaldi M_astounded his M_group M_in October 1934 M_with his discovery that by slowing down , rather than accelerating , neutrons , he could M_provoke intense nuclear reactions ."
a98-fragment03,72,He M_held a chair M_in physics M_from 1937 M_until his retirement publishing more than 150 papers M_on atomic and nuclear physics .
a98-fragment03,73,"He was M_awarded honorary degrees by Algiers , Glasgow and Oxford ."
a98-fragment03,74,"He became a founder , and active executive , M_of the European Centre for Nuclear Research in Geneva ."
a98-fragment03,75,I M_had the pleasure M_of two M_long talks last year M_with Professor Amaldi M_about his knowledge M_of what the German physicists were doing M_with their atoms during the war years .
a98-fragment03,76,"M_Apart M_for his incongruously white hair , Amaldi seemed to M_have the mental lucidity and expected energy M_of a man half his age ."
a98-fragment03,77,"His modesty , considering his world-wide fame M_in his M_field , was endearing ."
a98-fragment03,78,I knew almost nothing M_about physics but we M_shared some jokes M_about the Rome telephone system .
a98-fragment03,79,"M_In 1949 , Amaldi wrote M_to the Italian prime minister M_asking M_for permission to produce and sell sealing wax M_for letters , ‰Û÷ so that we may M_raise needed funds M_for our physics lab ‰Ûª ."
a98-fragment03,80,The reply M_came M_from an under-secretary who M_said that the M_present funding was considered adequate and the commercial undertaking would be ill-advised .
a98-fragment03,81,"It was signed by Giulio Andreotti , the M_present prime minister ."
a98-fragment03,82,"George Armstrong Edoardo Amaldi , born Carpaneto Piacentino September 5 , 1908 ; died Rome , December 5 , 1989 ."
a9j-fragment01,1,M_Midwife M_at the M_birth M_of a state .
a9j-fragment01,2,THE INTIFADA is a people 's M_unarmed M_revolution M_against occupation .
a9j-fragment01,3,"Its two main slogans , repeated countless times M_in the directives M_issued by the M_underground leadership , are M_freedom and independence ."
a9j-fragment01,4,It has M_employed a dual M_strategy to achieve M_these two M_objectives .
a9j-fragment01,5,"First , a comprehensive civil disobedience M_campaign was begun by which people M_severed , or M_minimised , all the M_contact M_points by which they were M_bound M_to the Israeli occupation authority ."
a9j-fragment01,6,"M_This M_campaign included resignations M_of Palestinian officials M_from public posts , the boycott M_of Israeli goods and products , and the refusal to pay taxes and fines ."
a9j-fragment01,7,"Partial and M_full M_strikes , demonstrations , sit-ins , conventions ‰Û_ all M_these have M_in fact only constituted the M_outer M_layer M_of an M_inner M_mechanism M_of civilian rebellion ."
a9j-fragment01,8,"The second , and complementary , M_part M_of the Intifada strategy M_concentrated M_on the M_construction M_of an indigenous national authority ."
a9j-fragment01,9,"As Israel 's authority was being M_lifted , the population began creating an alternative authority M_of their own ."
a9j-fragment01,10,"Popular committees were established in villages , refugee camps , suburbs , streets , M_in fact in every community ."
a9j-fragment01,11,"Some M_headway was M_made M_in M_expanding self-sufficiency , whether M_through utilising more land M_for agriculture , developing M_home economies , or M_encouraging local manufacturers and products ."
a9j-fragment01,12,"Villages and refugee camps were thus being developed M_into ‰Û÷ M_liberated ‰Ûª or ‰Û÷ independent ‰Ûª areas , if not militarily , then at least psychologically , politically and infrastructurally ."
a9j-fragment01,13,"Bloody M_clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided M_these villages , storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and M_responding M_to rocks being thrown with M_live bullets and tear gas ; but no sooner would M_these army units be M_gone than authority would revert M_to the village residents ."
a9j-fragment01,14,"Palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires , road blocks would again be erected , and life M_in all its M_aspects would once again be M_run by the local leadership ."
a9j-fragment01,15,"The M_structure M_of the developing national authority has been both M_diffuse enough to prevent M_it M_from being M_destroyed by any one single M_sweep M_of arrests ( there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the Intifada 's outbreak ) , and coherent enough to M_allow M_for the existence M_of a unified M_resistance strategy ."
a9j-fragment01,16,"While the entire M_network M_of popular committees , local institutions and the general public constitute the M_field M_commanders M_in the M_battle M_of civilian disobedience and M_of M_constructing a political infrastructure , a M_rotating Unified National Command M_acts M_in the M_role of field-general , issuing a bi-monthly directive M_outlining policy and determining specific M_resistance programmes ."
a9j-fragment01,17,"A M_high M_level M_of M_mobility M_in the M_structure M_allows M_for M_continuous M_interchange M_of M_roles and ideas , and M_retains M_for the Unified National Command the M_closeness M_to M_grass M_roots that is required to M_make M_it truly M_reflect people 's wishes and sentiments ."
a9j-fragment01,18,"M_THIS M_expanded M_network M_of popular committees and institutions M_making M_up the Unified leadership is M_infused by tens of thousands of activists who M_belong M_to , or M_identify M_with , the different factions M_of the PLO ."
a9j-fragment01,19,"M_In effect , therefore , the PLO M_exists M_at all M_levels M_of organisation within the occupied territories ."
a9j-fragment01,20,Thus the Palestinian national M_movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an M_organic whole .
a9j-fragment01,21,The M_pattern M_of the Intifada has been cyclical .
a9j-fragment01,22,"M_Thrusts M_of M_resistance ( mass demonstrations , resignations , tax rebellions , etc ) would M_come M_in M_crests ."
a9j-fragment01,23,"The M_pattern is determined by a M_wide variety M_of factors , including what the Israeli army M_does ."
a9j-fragment01,24,"But the M_relation is complex , not M_uni-directional ."
a9j-fragment01,25,"M_Harsh M_measures ‰ÛÓ M_putting an entire community M_under an absolute curfew M_for a M_continuous lengthy period M_of time , demolishing homes , uprooting olive or citrus trees , physical intimidation and terror tactics M_employed by raiding army units , shooting , killing , M_cutting M_off water or electricity supplies and telephone M_links M_to villages or towns , mass arrests , intimidatory interrogation techniques ‰ÛÓ can either create a temporary lull or M_activate an M_eruption ."
a9j-fragment01,26,The army never M_knows which it will be .
a9j-fragment01,27,It is as if it is M_walking M_through a M_minefield .
a9j-fragment01,28,"The M_wave-like M_pattern M_of the Intifada , its M_pains and M_sufferings , are all reminiscent M_of the M_process M_of M_birth ."
a9j-fragment01,29,"The metaphor is apt , as Palestinians M_regard themselves as engaging M_in a process M_of M_giving M_birth M_to their independent Palestinian state ."
a9j-fragment01,30,"M_Through their M_revolution , the M_masses are both M_mother and M_midwife M_to the M_birth M_of M_this state ."
a9j-fragment01,31,The Intifada is the M_midwife M_of M_freedom .
a9j-fragment01,32,"M_Through it , Palestinians are M_struggling M_on a daily basis to M_shake M_off Israel 's authority and to M_construct their own ."
a9j-fragment01,33,"The M_struggle M_reflects a M_revolution M_in mass M_consciousness , by which people have M_come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied M_in manifest acts if reality is to be M_changed ."
a9j-fragment01,34,"Thus , wherever one M_looks , one M_finds people engaged M_in the M_construction M_of the M_blocks that will M_make M_up the Palestinian state ."
a9j-fragment01,35,It is a M_conscious effort .
a9j-fragment01,36,The M_masses are being engaged M_in the M_craft M_of M_state-masonry .
a9j-fragment01,37,"M_In M_this process M_of state M_building , many M_stages have been M_covered ."
a9j-fragment01,38,The Declaration of Independence M_issued by the Palestine National Council ( PNC ) M_on November 15 last year constitutes a major M_landmark M_along M_this M_road .
a9j-fragment01,39,"Its significance M_lies M_in its M_double M_message : that the M_aim M_of the Palestinian M_struggle is the establishment M_of Palestinian independence , and that M_this independence is M_regarded as being not M_at Israel 's M_expense ."
a9j-fragment01,40,"M_This has been a constant theme M_of Intifada policy : that we wish to M_build ( Palestine ) , not to M_destroy ( Israel ) ; that we wish to achieve M_freedom ( M_for our people ) , not to deprive others ( Israelis ) M_of M_it ; that we wish to protect and save lives ( ours ) , not to endanger the lives M_of others ( Israelis ) ."
a9j-fragment01,41,"M_In one of several Intifada leaflets written M_in Hebrew and M_addressed M_to the Israeli soldiers M_on duty in the occupied territories , the M_message was repeated : Soldier , go home ."
a9j-fragment01,42,Return to your family and children .
a9j-fragment01,43,Be with them M_in peace so that we may remain with our family and children M_in peace .
a9j-fragment01,44,"We do not wish to M_harm you , or your state ."
a9j-fragment01,45,"We wish to be M_unharmed , M_in our own state ."
a9j-fragment01,46,How can the process M_of state M_building be developed ?
a9j-fragment01,47,"If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major M_landmark M_in M_this process , the time has M_come to M_embark M_on another major M_step , M_that M_of M_declaring the M_setting M_up M_of a state or government M_structure ."
a9j-fragment01,48,AN ESCALATION M_of the Intifada M_in M_this M_direction would M_serve two purposes at once .
a9j-fragment01,49,"First , it would M_consolidate the M_structures M_of the M_developing national authority which is M_competing to M_replace the occupation authority ."
a9j-fragment01,50,"Second , it would M_consolidate the M_image and M_essence M_of the Intifada as a constructive , not a destructive , M_force ."
a9j-fragment01,51,"Naturally , to M_embark M_on such a M_step is not necessarily to succeed M_immediately M_in realising M_it ."
a9j-fragment01,52,"Rather , it is a M_challenge ."
a9j-fragment01,53,"It will be a further M_challenge M_to Israel 's occupation , M_conceived M_in the M_image M_of earlier M_challenges M_of the Intifada ."
a9j-fragment01,54,"But it will also be a M_challenge M_to us , Palestinians , M_summoning us to work more energetically M_towards the idea 's fulfilment ."
a9j-fragment01,55,"It would be a M_natural M_extension M_of the Intifada 's dual M_strategy M_towards M_disengagement M_from Israel , and the corresponding process M_of state M_building ."
a9j-fragment01,56,It would M_further M_naturalise and legitimise the M_evolving M_skeletal M_form M_of Palestinian independence .
a9j-fragment01,57,It would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities M_with a more advanced M_form M_of organisation and M_structure .
a9j-fragment01,58,It would enable better planning and performance .
a9j-fragment01,59,"It would M_maximise civilian M_tactics M_of M_resistance and M_defuse the M_natural potential M_for violence , M_containing and eventually eliminating the M_marginal but intrusive phenomenon M_of collaborator activation by Israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local Palestinians ."
a9j-fragment01,60,It would create a further fact that would M_put Israel M_on the M_spot .
a9j-fragment01,61,"Israel 's M_reaction , however M_hostile , could only further our cause ."
a9j-fragment01,62,"Arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of Palestinian professionals who would be employed M_in perfectly apolitical , M_harmless and humanitarian jobs can only M_further M_isolate the Israeli Government ."
a9j-fragment01,63,M_Half-way M_measures can only M_imply M_half-way success .
a9j-fragment01,64,A modus vivendi would also M_imply success .
a9j-fragment01,65,"In general , our policy should be to M_proceed M_with M_building our state M_block M_by M_block , M_without waiting to be M_given a M_gift M_of it M_through negotiations ."
a9j-fragment01,66,We should M_regard negotiations rather as the M_means by which we could establish M_formal agreements M_between our state and Israel .
a9j-fragment01,67,Such agreements can M_range M_from the issue M_of M_borders M_to the issue M_of M_free wave-lengths M_for our future television and radio networks .
a9j-fragment01,68,"M_In the meantime , we M_have the M_capacity to M_bring coherence and organisation M_to a M_whole M_range M_of activities , M_further consolidating the institutional M_linkage M_between the people in the occupied state and the PLO leadership ."
a9j-fragment01,69,"Entire departments can be M_set M_up , M_in health , foreign affairs , agriculture , trade , finance , education , justice , religion , information and social welfare ."
a9j-fragment01,70,"A M_pyramid administrative M_structure , establishing M_links M_from popular committees in villages right M_up M_to the Executive Committee M_of the PLO ( M_in its M_capacity as a Cabinet ) , can be established ."
a9j-fragment01,71,During the Intifada the people have been M_engaged M_in M_building the M_side M_walls .
a9j-fragment01,72,A government would provide the M_roof which would M_bring M_these M_walls M_together .
a9j-fragment01,73,It would M_add another necessary M_touch M_in the process M_of creating a Palestinian M_home .
a9j-fragment01,74,"Sari Nusseibeh , a M_leading Palestinian intellectual , is professor M_of philosophy M_at Bir Zeit , the West Bank university M_closed by the Israelis early last year ."
a9j-fragment01,75,His ideas are widely influential M_among Palestinians .

a9j-fragment01,77,‰Û÷ The Palestinian national M_movement inside and outside the occupied territories is an M_organic whole ‰Ûª PHOTOGRAPH : DAVID SILLITOE
ab9-fragment03,791,"The boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle , the boy , a light , tall fourteen-year-old , M_labouring in wellington boots too large for him , and the dog , a three-year-old Labrador bitch , M_picking her way reluctantly , M_with frequent pauses , as if her paws hurt ."
ab9-fragment03,792,"The boy , unlike the dog , knew that the mud did not M_go M_on for ever ; beyond the bridge , the disused railway embankment along which they were walking became built up , so that water M_ran off it ."
ab9-fragment03,793,"He pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed M_string of horses and Ponies go past , waving shyly M_to the lead rider , a pretty , capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him ."
ab9-fragment03,794,"He watched her as she went past M_at a walk , the black Labrador and he both gazing wistfully , their breath steaming M_in the cold February morning ."
ab9-fragment03,795,"He waited till the horses were well away and looked round the wide , flat landscape carefully before unclipping the lead ."
ab9-fragment03,796,"‰Û÷ Way you go , Patty , ‰Ûª he said M_softly , and the dog was off , M_hurling herself along the embankment , all paws and M_flying ears , after a rabbit who had been M_sitting M_in a M_patch of sun but disappeared M_with M_contemptuous ease as she came close ."
ab9-fragment03,797,The boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead ‰ÛÓ the riding-school only M_used the land by M_grace of its owner and it was a shooting M_estate ‰ÛÓ but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come M_to his call .
ab9-fragment03,798,"He stood for a moment laughing M_at her as she M_cast M_furiously for the vanished rabbit , and walked on , to M_catch her M_up , along the raised embankment ."
ab9-fragment03,799,"The trees had M_grown M_up beside it M_in the twenty-five years since the railway had M_closed , and the boy stopped every M_now and M_then to watch small birds hopping around the top branches ."
ab9-fragment03,800,"He particularly liked this M_stretch ; nothing but the M_odd tractor and the horses ever came M_down this embankment , and the birds were unworried by his presence ."
ab9-fragment03,801,"M_After half a mile he decided to turn off the embankment and walk M_up the side of the next field and along the path at the top of it , following the horses whom he could still see M_in the distance ."
ab9-fragment03,802,He called Patty M_to him .
ab9-fragment03,803,"She did n't come , which was surprising ; she was a docile creature and particularly devoted M_to him because he always took her for a walk when he was at the stables ."
ab9-fragment03,804,He could hear her barking and looked down over the steep side of the embankment to the bottom of the trees .
ab9-fragment03,805,"He called her again and again , but she would not stop barking M_at something he could not see ."
ab9-fragment03,806,"Probably a squirrel , he decided , and M_slithered down the side of the embankment to M_join her , scolding as he went ."
ab9-fragment03,807,"Straightening up beside the dog , he looked where she was looking , and blinked ."
ab9-fragment03,808,"He saw a leg , uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees , swollen grotesquely , and M_gazed at it , stupidly , wondering if it was plastic ."
ab9-fragment03,809,"As his eyes focused he realized he was looking M_at a hideously swollen human body , and just then , as the M_light breeze M_shifted , he M_caught the M_stomach-turning odour of decay ."
ab9-fragment03,810,"He was a sensible and capable boy , an eldest child , so he moved closer , trying not to breathe , and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen : a body , must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt , lying face down , head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top ."
ab9-fragment03,811,"He clipped the lead on to the dog with cold hands which would hardly function , and let her pull him up the slope as fast as he could M_make his legs move ."
ab9-fragment03,812,"He stopped on the embankment , shaking M_with cold and shock , to M_note the M_spot , then fled along the tractor paths , the dog running with him , to the stables where the ten o'clock children 's ride was M_in its M_closing M_stages ."
ab9-fragment03,813,‰Û÷ Miss Williams ! ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,814,"‰Û÷ Jamie , I 'm teaching . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,815,"The thin , capable woman who was M_taking the riding-class looked M_at him M_in amazement as he leaned panting on the gate to the ring , the dog M_whining beside him ."
ab9-fragment03,816,‰Û÷ I 'm sorry .
ab9-fragment03,817,"Please , I 've found something , I must tell you ."
ab9-fragment03,818,"She had known him since he was a very small five-year-old , M_perched like a M_mosquito on one of the placid beginners ' ponies , so she told the class to carry on walking their ponies while she came to him ."
ab9-fragment03,819,‰Û÷ There 's someone dead .
ab9-fragment03,820,Below the railway embankment . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,821,‰Û÷ Are you sure ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,822,The boy looked M_at her and uncontrollable tears suddenly M_filled his eyes .
ab9-fragment03,823,"He was very nearly as tall as her , but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which M_served as the stable office , calling M_to one of the stable girls to take over the class ."
ab9-fragment03,824,‰Û÷ Patty found her .
ab9-fragment03,825,"She 's just lying there , but she is dead . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,826,He scrubbed at his face with the handkerchief she offered and M_gulped for air .
ab9-fragment03,827,‰Û÷ I 'll ring the police . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,828,"She did so , M_casting an experienced eye M_over him ."
ab9-fragment03,829,"‰Û÷ Sit down here , Jamie , and I 'll make some tea ."
ab9-fragment03,830,"Mummy will come back M_in a few minutes , wo n't she , for Susie ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,831,‰Û÷ Not Mummy .
ab9-fragment03,832,Aunt Margaret is coming M_at ten . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,833,"The boy thought longingly of his mother , but managed to help Miss Williams describe the location of the body M_to a startled local station M_sergeant and to drink a cup of sweet milky tea M_without being sick ."
ab9-fragment03,834,"M_By the time his aunt arrived Jamie was so M_far recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to M_point M_out , severely , that he would be needed , either to assist the police or to be lead rider M_in the eleven-thirty class , or possibly both ."
ab9-fragment03,835,"He watched his aunt and Miss Williams wordlessly consult each other , but knew his aunt would do as she was told ; successful M_solicitor though she was , she was ten years younger than Miss Williams and , as she complained , totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress ."
ab9-fragment03,836,"He was unsurprised to find her packed off M_firmly to take his sister home , leaving him as a person of major importance M_in what he instantly M_assumed to be a real murder ."
ab9-fragment03,837,"Miss Williams took him to meet the police Land Rover at the stable gate , a bone-thin , M_wiry woman M_in her late fifties , her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents , M_edging cars through the gate to M_collect children M_from the ten o'clock ride , M_from asking any questions ."
ab9-fragment03,838,"Jamie , M_through a renewed M_queasiness , just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced M_to M_half his age by Miss Williams 's greeting ."
ab9-fragment03,839,"‰Û÷ He was one of my boys , ‰Ûª she said M_in explanation M_to the CID M_sergeant who was M_leading the party as they bumped over the rough road , through the thick mud and on to the dry embankment ."
ab9-fragment03,840,‰Û÷ Like Jamie here . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,841,"‰Û÷ Did you recognize the person you found , young man ? ‰Ûª the M_sergeant asked , carefully ."
ab9-fragment03,842,‰Û÷ No . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,843,Tears started into Jamie 's eyes .
ab9-fragment03,844,‰Û÷ She was all swollen . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,845,"The M_sergeant 's eyes widened , and he slid out of the Land Rover and stood back to let Jamie out ."
ab9-fragment03,846,‰Û÷ Very competent boy .
ab9-fragment03,847,"Almost a professional singer , M_handles himself very well . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,848,"Miss Williams 's natural pitch , well suited M_to M_reaching across a hunting-field , was discreetly M_reduced ."
ab9-fragment03,849,"The CID M_sergeant thanked her gravely and went to stand beside Jamie who was peering down the embankment , looking pinched ."
ab9-fragment03,850,"‰Û÷ We 'll go down together , lad . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,851,‰Û÷ There is n't room .
ab9-fragment03,852,I 'll lead . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,853,"He M_took a M_deep breath and headed down , the M_sergeant , two constables and Miss Williams M_in his M_wake ."
ab9-fragment03,854,"Soon they all stood side by side , one of the younger policemen coughing involuntarily ."
ab9-fragment03,855,"‰Û÷ Oh dear , oh dear , ‰Ûª Miss Williams said M_on an indrawn breath ."
ab9-fragment03,856,‰Û÷ Sorry .
ab9-fragment03,857,"Come along , Jamie , let's get you back . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,858,She took out a handkerchief and M_mopped her eyes .
ab9-fragment03,859,"The police driver M_shot Jamie a look of enquiry which he M_missed , M_occupied as he was M_with guiding Miss Williams M_back up the hill ."
ab9-fragment03,860,"He had seen her weep before but only for a sick horse , and he was awe-struck ."
ab9-fragment03,861,"‰Û÷ Jamie , did you let Patty off the lead ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,862,The boy blushed M_to his ears and owned M_to it .
ab9-fragment03,863,"‰Û÷ You must not do it , Jamie , we 'll be M_in trouble M_with Colonel James , I 've told all you boys a thousand times . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,864,"‰Û÷ He 'll perhaps not do it again , ‰Ûª the M_sergeant murmured , and received the look that Miss Williams habitually M_bent M_on a child who was riding carelessly ."
ab9-fragment03,865,‰Û÷ How M_long had she been there ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,866,"Jamie asked , anxiously ."
ab9-fragment03,867,"‰Û÷ A few days , ‰Ûª the M_sergeant said , grimly ."
ab9-fragment03,868,‰Û÷ How many ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,869,‰Û÷ Doctor 'll tell us . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,870,"He considered the boy thoughtfully , and decided to take him M_back quickly ."
ab9-fragment03,871,These teenagers were M_in his experience a lot less M_tough than they looked .
ab9-fragment03,872,‰Û÷ Any idea who it could be ? ‰Ûª he asked Miss Williams casually .
ab9-fragment03,873,‰Û÷ No .
ab9-fragment03,874,But only a local would know to put a body there .
ab9-fragment03,875,If Jamie had n't let the dog off the lead she could have been there much longer . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,876,"The M_sergeant nodded , deciding it could M_do no harm to M_concede a M_point he had already M_taken ."
ab9-fragment03,877,"‰Û÷ No one could M_tell who she was , surely ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,878,"Miss Williams said quietly M_to him , sounding shaky ."
ab9-fragment03,879,‰Û÷ She did n't even look human . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,880,The M_sergeant M_confirmed that that happened M_with bodies M_after a few days .
ab9-fragment03,881,"‰Û÷ We 'll identify her , though , ‰Ûª he said , reassuringly ."
ab9-fragment03,882,‰Û÷ Somebody will likely have reported her missing . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,883,"He stopped , abruptly , as he remembered a conversation earlier M_that week , and M_lit a cigarette , thinking M_furiously ."
ab9-fragment03,884,"This could be the girl whom the Yard were looking for , and he had better do everything very quickly indeed , M_including finding his Chief , who would then want to find his Chief Constable and notify Scotland Yard ."
ab9-fragment03,885,"Presumably it would be the Yard who investigated M_this one , rather than the regional crime M_squad ."
ab9-fragment03,886,"He chewed his thumbnail as he walked , out of M_long experience M_keeping M_in mind the M_highest priorities : Ensure Body Not Moved and Ensure M_Next of Kin Notified before the Press M_got the story ."
ab9-fragment03,887,"He posted the detective constable he M_had with him M_back M_down the path to M_join his colleague , M_armed M_with instructions to M_repel all attempts by anyone , however M_senior or M_armed M_with whatever authority , to go anywhere near the body unless he , M_Sergeant Black , personally accompanied them ."
ab9-fragment03,888,"Then he climbed into the Land Rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast , M_with the M_aim of abandoning Jamie M_to the custody of his aunt as M_quickly as possible ."
ab9-fragment03,889,"He could see with M_half an eye that the kid 's aunt was going to be one of the confident , bossy , M_well-connected women with whom that part of Cambridgeshire was M_substantially M_over-provided ."
ab9-fragment03,890,"John McLeish was in his office , Saturday or no Saturday , telling himself he needed to M_catch M_up M_on the paperwork ."
ab9-fragment03,891,"The phone rang and he picked it up , frowning ."
ab9-fragment03,892,One of the pleasures of Saturday working was that the phone did not ring all the time .
ab9-fragment03,893,The voice at the other end was plainly over-excited and it M_took him a minute to M_disentangle what he was being told .
ab9-fragment03,894,"‰Û÷ Oh congratulations , Charlie ."
ab9-fragment03,895,"Sorry , what did you say it was again ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,896,‰Û÷ A little girl .
ab9-fragment03,897,"Actually a very big girl as M_these M_things M_go , nine pounds ."
ab9-fragment03,898,"It 's M_fantastic , John , there she is , a new person , lying on her face , sound asleep ."
ab9-fragment03,899,I 've just left them and I 'm going back . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,900,McLeish repressed the malicious thought that M_this event might put Francesca 's M_nose just a little bit out of M_joint .
ab9-fragment03,901,She had been utterly secure M_in her M_position as the only girl M_in the Wilson family and now there was another one .
ab9-fragment03,902,‰Û÷ I 've got another M_bit of good news .
ab9-fragment03,903,"Frannie 's going to be able to bring Tristram home pretty soon , apparently . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,904,McLeish expressed M_qualified enthusiasm and Charlie assured him he M_felt exactly the same M_about his younger brother .
ab9-fragment03,905,‰Û÷ The difficulty is that Perry does everything M_that M_bit better than Tristram .
ab9-fragment03,906,"Not that M_this is any excuse , John , I do know . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,907,"He paused , reminding McLeish M_irresistibly of a M_Labrador M_wondering how best to M_approach an M_acquaintance ."
ab9-fragment03,908,"‰Û÷ I wanted to say , you M_see , that I know you thought Frannie should n't have gone , and that it 's ruined your holiday M_plans , and , on behalf of us all , I 'm sorry ."
ab9-fragment03,909,I know the little boys M_lean M_on her too much and I would have gone if I could . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,910,"He coughed , embarrassed and a little pompous , very much conscious of his new status as a father , while McLeish remembered that he was a scant four years older than the delinquent Tristram ."
ab9-fragment03,911,"‰Û÷ Anyway she should be M_back soon , ‰Ûª Charlie concluded ."
ab9-fragment03,912,"McLeish thanked him gravely , M_feeling , as he often did M_with the Wilsons , that he was being M_enveloped M_in a large feather M_eiderdown , and , M_made restless by the M_call , went M_down the corridor to where he knew Catherine Crane was also in , M_getting her office M_in M_order ."
ab9-fragment03,913,He stopped at the door and smiled M_at her .
ab9-fragment03,914,"Wearing jeans and a blue shirt , she was tugging M_at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to M_embrace and which was M_threatening to M_over-balance on her ."
ab9-fragment03,915,She looked M_about sixteen and beautiful .
ab9-fragment03,916,"She M_let M_go of the cabinet , coughing in the dust of ages that M_appeared to be M_lurking behind it , and smiled M_back M_at him as the February sun shone through the small window behind her , M_throwing M_into M_sharp M_relief the M_patches on the wall where her predecessor had hung posters , and the ingrained dirt on the flaking paintwork round the M_mean , narrow , metal window ."
ab9-fragment03,917,‰Û÷ Where do you want that put ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,918,"McLeish advanced M_on the cabinet and shifted it authoritatively , ignoring the M_clip M_on the M_ankle dealt him by an unsecured bottom drawer apparently full of bricks ."
ab9-fragment03,919,"‰Û÷ I should have unloaded it first , ‰Ûª Catherine Crane said , apologetically , ‰Û÷ but I just could n't move M_in any direction with it where it was . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,920,"‰Û÷ I 'm here , just tell me if you want anything else shifted . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,921,He hesitated .
ab9-fragment03,922,"‰Û÷ I 'm going to M_do another hour , then M_have some lunch , if you want to come ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,923,"He was aware that he was not M_managing to sound exactly like a senior officer making a recent arrival M_feel M_at M_home , but decided not to M_add any M_further M_riders M_to his invitation ."
ab9-fragment03,924,‰Û÷ M_That would be very nice .
ab9-fragment03,925,Are we going to the canteen ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,926,‰Û÷ Not if I can help it .
ab9-fragment03,927,What M_about the pub ?
ab9-fragment03,928,‰Û÷ If I 'm allowed to buy my own . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,929,McLeish considered .
ab9-fragment03,930,"‰Û÷ M_That 's fine M_on the food ‰ÛÓ I 'll buy the drinks , I 'm too old to get used to women buying my drinks . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,931,"She laughed M_at him and said gravely that she would be happy to indulge him , and he went away , grinning ."
ab9-fragment03,932,"Peter Yeo was also in his office , having told his wife he was lunching with a client ."
ab9-fragment03,933,"It was , he M_felt , just too difficult to be at home at all , M_with Claudia M_in a permanently bitchy mood and both his teenage children M_taking their M_cue M_from her and behaving intolerably ."
ab9-fragment03,934,"He wandered restlessly about , and decided that the lie might as well M_become the truth ."
ab9-fragment03,935,"Without Angela Morgan , at least two major clients were M_in danger of not M_getting the M_assiduous service they were paying for , and it would be M_well M_worth trying to M_see if one of them , whom he knew to be a fellow M_refugee M_from family life M_at the weekends , could be found ."
ab9-fragment03,936,"He was M_in luck , and M_fixed to meet Andy Barton at Brazzo 's where Yeo Davis M_had a table permanently M_booked ."
ab9-fragment03,937,He had to M_admit that M_this particular client hardly M_added M_to the general decorative M_smartness of the place .
ab9-fragment03,938,"Andy Barton , founder and chief executive of Barton Textiles , was almost as broad as he was long , virtually neckless , with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar ."
ab9-fragment03,939,"His enormous hands dwarfed the elegant menu which he was studying M_in apparent disbelief , and Peter Yeo noticed again , as Barton M_without rising extended one massive M_paw , that though the fingers were an ordinary length it was the width of the palms that M_made the hands so large ."
ab9-fragment03,940,"‰Û÷ I never M_see how they M_get the sales per square M_foot in M_these places , ‰Ûª Barton M_observed , M_without further greeting ."
ab9-fragment03,941,"‰Û÷ I mean , they 're not M_open twelve hours like my shops , and they are n't M_using the space . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,942,"His small M_bright blue eyes M_swept disparagingly M_over the minimalized black and white flooring , stainless steel chairs and black wooden bar ."
ab9-fragment03,943,"‰Û÷ They M_make a M_huge M_margin M_on a M_smaller M_turnover , Andy , M_out M_of M_punters like us . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,944,"Peter Yeo was amused by , and respectful of , a man M_with an obsession ."
ab9-fragment03,945,‰Û÷ Angela not working today ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,946,"Barton worked a sixteen-hour day , which M_began M_with M_careful , detailed consideration of the trading figures and key M_ratios for every one of his forty-three major shops and the M_output of both factories , and continued , usually by helicopter , M_with a detailed aerial survey of a particular area as the M_quick M_way of M_identifying new sites , M_interspersed M_with unheralded M_descents M_on the manager of any shop he M_took a M_fancy to visit ."
ab9-fragment03,947,"Peter Yeo , who had known M_this particular M_juggernaut since he had his first small factory and two M_stores and dirt under his fingernails M_from shifting packing-cases personally , was not fazed by the question ."
ab9-fragment03,948,"‰Û÷ Angela 's M_taking a few days M_off ‰ÛÓ she has n't been well , ‰Ûª he said , M_easily ."
ab9-fragment03,949,‰Û÷ I know she 's been working very M_hard for you .
ab9-fragment03,950,"I 'm M_up M_to M_speed M_with Huerter , of course , but is your M_planning M_application in Leicester all right ? ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,951,Barton assured him M_warmly that Angela had done a M_great M_job and he was M_now confident of M_getting M_planning permission M_on the vast site he had wanted .
ab9-fragment03,952,"Peter Yeo , who knew him M_in M_this M_over-candid , M_over-emphatic mood , decided to M_prod gently ."
ab9-fragment03,953,‰Û÷ Angela said the council wanted it M_for housing ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,954,"‰Û÷ Yeah , some of them did ."
ab9-fragment03,955,"Silly buggers , it 's jobs they want M_there first ."
ab9-fragment03,956,Plenty of housing if M_those stupid M_farts M_at the council got round to repairing it and M_stopped their tenants tearing apart what they have got .
ab9-fragment03,957,My Mum brought up five of us in a flat M_far worse than what M_these immigrants complain M_about . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,958,"Peter Yeo , who had personally persuaded Barton of the M_presentational disadvantage of using words like ‰Û÷ darkies ‰Ûª , ‰Û÷ niggers ‰Ûª or ‰Û÷ wogs ‰Ûª , decided that ‰Û÷ immigrants ‰Ûª even though used M_in the manner of one M_invoking a M_curse , was as good as he was going to M_get M_with M_this particular client ."
ab9-fragment03,959,"‰Û÷ She 's doing a good M_job M_on M_sorting M_this Huerter M_thing , too ."
ab9-fragment03,960,M_Bloody ridiculous them blokes M_at the DTI M_pushing assistance for Huerter .
ab9-fragment03,961,I voted for M_this government because they said they were n't going to go in for M_that sort of M_rubbish .
ab9-fragment03,962,No one ever gave me anything and my business M_works .
ab9-fragment03,963,"Still , Angie can M_fix the Treasury M_on M_this one , given her boyfriend , ca n't she ?"
ab9-fragment03,964,M_That 's the reason I wanted you M_on M_this . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,965,"Peter Yeo M_winced inwardly , but he was not going to tell Andy Barton that Angela was missing , or M_express any of his M_reservations M_about how much M_influence Angela could M_bring to M_bear ."
ab9-fragment03,966,"He M_smoothly M_changed the M_subject M_to the M_looks of the blond M_model , three tables away , and Barton agreed he would n't mind a M_bit of M_that ; M_on the M_thin M_side , M_mind M_you , but M_tasty ."
ab9-fragment03,967,"The M_rest of lunch M_passed M_in similar M_diversion , M_interspersed M_with details of last week 's M_turnover which were never M_far M_from Barton 's mind , whatever other M_distractions M_offered ."
ab9-fragment03,968,Mrs Huntley was M_having lunch with her daughter .
ab9-fragment03,969,"She ate placidly , acknowledging M_to herself M_with her customary good M_sense that M_at the moment , as M_at any time since her brother William had died , she and Penelope were M_getting no pleasure at all M_from each other 's company ."
ab9-fragment03,970,"Penelope was looking particularly discontented and M_disaffected , picking at her food ."
ab9-fragment03,971,"Her red suit was M_smart , but too M_bright a colour for her pale English pink and white skin , her brown hair could have M_done M_with a wash and her nails were ragged and bitten ."
ab9-fragment03,972,"She was frowning , deep M_lines M_appearing between her eyebrows , mouth M_drawn down at the edges so that instead of a classically good-looking slim English M_Rose M_in her late twenties , she looked M_faded , years older than her real age , and shrewish ."
ab9-fragment03,973,"Mrs Huntley sighed ; her brother whom she had loved , but knew to be self-indulgent M_to a M_fault , had M_done his niece real M_harm by M_leaving so much of his money M_away M_from the girl who had confidently believed herself to be his favourite M_thing on earth ."
ab9-fragment03,974,"Penelope , however , it had to be acknowledged , had M_made no attempt to M_rise M_above the M_blow she had been M_dealt by finding a M_dazzling girl of her own age favoured M_over herself M_in her uncle 's M_will ."
ab9-fragment03,975,"At least , Mrs Huntley thought hopefully , she had M_stopped wondering , M_unbecomingly and M_stridently , how her uncle could have been M_fooled by Angela Morgan ."
ab9-fragment03,976,"It was Grizel Huntley 's own M_view that her brother had not been M_fooled at all but had been M_charmed and M_diverted by a dashing girl thirty years his junior , and had M_seen no reason at all why she should not M_have a M_share of his M_considerable M_estate when M_that M_left a very M_decent M_down-setting for his niece as well ."
ab9-fragment03,977,"Indeed , she had respected Angela Morgan for the M_straightforwardness M_with which she had M_tackled the issue when they had met at the lawyer 's office ."
ab9-fragment03,978,"‰Û÷ I 'm sorry you 're disappointed , ‰Ûª she had said M_to Penelope , ‰Û÷ but M_after all there 's a M_lot of money , quite enough for both of us . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,979,"So there was , Grizel Huntley acknowledged , and it would be a great deal better if Penny could M_manage to think a bit more positively ."
ab9-fragment03,980,"‰Û÷ If she has vanished , I 'm going to M_see M_that solicitor M_about whether I can M_get her presumed dead . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,981,"Penny , sounding childishly , sullenly M_determined , M_broke M_into her mother 's thoughts ."
ab9-fragment03,982,"Grizel Huntley looked M_across M_at her , M_shocked ."
ab9-fragment03,983,‰Û÷ I would wait a little if I were you . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,984,"Penelope M_glared M_at her , turning an M_ungraceful scarlet , but Mrs Huntley M_held her M_ground ."
ab9-fragment03,985,"‰Û÷ You are being silly M_about M_this , Penny ."
ab9-fragment03,986,"You are M_letting M_this disappointment ‰ÛÓ and M_that 's all it is , you 're still a very well-off young woman ‰ÛÓ M_get M_in the M_way of everything . ‰Ûª"
ab9-fragment03,987,"Penelope choked M_on her pudding and started to cry , M_angry , uncontrollable tears ."
ab9-fragment03,988,"Grizel Huntley reached out to M_comfort her but she forced M_back her chair and M_fled , clutching her handbag and napkin , leaving her mother with the M_ruins of lunch ."
ab9-fragment03,989,"Fifty miles north , Sarah Morgan had just finished serving a lunch that no one had done more than pick at ."
ab9-fragment03,990,"Her husband Francis had made a slightly better M_showing than her daughter Jennifer , who was looking particularly M_ragged ."
ab9-fragment03,991,"Mother and daughter were very like each other , tall , M_dark , slim , pleasant-looking women with mid-brown curly hair and slightly snub noses ."
ab9-fragment03,992,"Francis Morgan , by M_contrast , was dark , almost black-haired , sallow-skinned , with M_bright brown eyes ."
ab9-fragment03,993,"Of medium height and M_packed M_with energy , even distressed as he was , he was M_bursting M_round the kitchen , hair still damp at the back M_from his swim ."
ab9-fragment03,994,‰Û÷ Let's go to the flicks .
ab9-fragment03,995,No M_point at all sitting round looking M_at each other .
ab9-fragment03,996,M_Come M_on Jennifer ‰ÛÓ or are you going out with Michael ? ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,997,"‰Û÷ He 's gone back to Australia , Dad ."
ab9-fragment03,998,Last week . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,999,"Jennifer sounded M_defeated , and he looked M_at her sideways M_with familiar love and exasperation ."
ab9-fragment03,1000,"She just did n't seem to be able to hang on to men , he thought impatiently , not like his Angie , wherever she was ."
ab9-fragment03,1001,"‰Û÷ Giles rang up , ‰Ûª his daughter M_volunteered , and he was M_uncomfortably reminded by something M_in her voice that Giles Hawick was one of the men Jennifer had n't been able to hang on to ‰ÛÓ or not once he had seen Angela ."
ab9-fragment03,1002,"‰Û÷ How was he ? ‰Ûª his wife Sarah asked , rather too quickly ."
ab9-fragment03,1003,"‰Û÷ M_Well , very worried ."
ab9-fragment03,1004,"He said the police were talking M_to everyone Angie had seen M_in the two weeks M_before she ‰Û_ well ‰Û_ vanished , and so M_far had come up with nothing ."
ab9-fragment03,1005,I mean no one noticed anything unusual M_about her and she seemed to be M_full of M_plans for the wedding . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,1006,"‰Û÷ M_Well , I told them M_that , ‰Ûª Francis Morgan said irritably and his wife and daughter M_caught each other 's M_eye M_in silent agreement that he had n't told them that Angela was refusing M_point-black to be married M_from home and was insisting M_on the M_full London M_set-out , M_reception at the House of Commons , replying unanswerably when he had objected M_on M_grounds of expense that she could well afford to pay for it herself ."
ab9-fragment03,1007,"A row of M_epic M_proportions had ensued , which he and Angela had evidently enjoyed but which had M_left Sarah and Jennifer M_sick M_with distress ."
ab9-fragment03,1008,"‰Û÷ I do n't want to go out , Frank ."
ab9-fragment03,1009,Someone might M_ring . ‰Ûª
ab9-fragment03,1010,"Sarah Morgan was sounding diffident but resolute , and as Morgan opened his mouth to protest M_in exasperation the doorbell rang ."
ab9-fragment03,1011,"Both women looked M_at him M_in joint M_appeal and he M_marched to the door , pulling it open M_with unnecessary force ."
ab9-fragment03,1012,"He stood , door in hand , M_checked by something M_in the M_way his visitors , a man and a woman , were standing ."
ab9-fragment03,1013,"The man , a stocky , greying fifty-year-old in a navy raincoat over a suit , his hair cut short , was attended by a uniformed policewoman , hair M_smartly set under the cap , her eyes M_watchful in the wide , flat , placid face , and both of them were standing M_square and M_stolid ."
ab9-fragment03,1014,"Francis Morgan stood and stared M_at them , and even M_before the man stepped forward steadily , hand extended , mouth opening to speak , he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him ."
ac2-fragment06,1251,"Mark Sanders returned from Istanbul M_feeling M_exhausted , depressed and ill ."
ac2-fragment06,1252,"The M_blinding headaches he had been experiencing M_in recent weeks were M_taking their M_toll , and he looked M_grey and drawn when he arrived home ."
ac2-fragment06,1253,"Lately , Georgina had been worried by the general deterioration M_in his appearance ."
ac2-fragment06,1254,But now she was visibly M_shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which M_kissed her .
ac2-fragment06,1255,"She wanted to say , ‰Û÷ You look awful , darling , ‰Ûª but decided M_against it ."
ac2-fragment06,1256,‰Û÷ What kind of a trip have you M_had ? ‰Ûª she asked instead .
ac2-fragment06,1257,"‰Û÷ Oh , not too bad , ‰Ûª he replied wearily ."
ac2-fragment06,1258,She took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs .
ac2-fragment06,1259,"‰Û÷ Come into the kitchen , and we will M_have a cup of tea ."
ac2-fragment06,1260,I 'M_ve so much news to tell you .
ac2-fragment06,1261,All sorts of M_things seem to have happened while you have been away M_this time . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1262,Mark smiled M_thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek .
ac2-fragment06,1263,"‰Û÷ Tell me M_about it , ‰Ûª he replied ."
ac2-fragment06,1264,‰Û÷ I could do M_with a good laugh . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1265,‰Û÷ Why darling ?
ac2-fragment06,1266,What 's the matter ?
ac2-fragment06,1267,Trouble at t'mill ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1268,Mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen .
ac2-fragment06,1269,"‰Û÷ Perhaps it 's old Montezuma 's revenge , ‰Ûª he replied ."
ac2-fragment06,1270,"‰Û÷ Must be M_getting too old for M_this globe-trotting M_lark , or else my M_mis-spent youth is M_catching M_up M_on me ."
ac2-fragment06,1271,I 'm rapidly M_coming M_to the conclusion that M_this is a young man 's M_game . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1272,"‰Û÷ Nonsense , Mark ."
ac2-fragment06,1273,"You 're still a young man ‰Û_ well , youngish. ‰Ûª she said , trying to M_tease him M_out M_of his apparent lethargy and M_depression ."
ac2-fragment06,1274,‰Û÷ Let's M_have M_that cup of tea and you 'll M_feel better . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1275,"‰Û÷ Ah , fill the cup , what M_boots it to repeat , how time is M_slipping underneath our feet , ‰Ûª he quoted M_with a sigh ."
ac2-fragment06,1276,‰Û÷ Oh darling .
ac2-fragment06,1277,What a M_sad M_sack we are today .
ac2-fragment06,1278,Is M_that how you M_feel ?
ac2-fragment06,1279,Shall I M_accompany you M_on the violin ?
ac2-fragment06,1280,Now let me tell you all the news . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1281,She poured the tea .
ac2-fragment06,1282,‰Û÷ Christopher has been promoted M_after only one year .
ac2-fragment06,1283,"The Chairman of the company told him he was most impressed M_with the M_contribution he 's M_made M_to the business , and that he could M_go right M_to the M_top if he M_keeps it M_up ."
ac2-fragment06,1284,I knew you 'd be delighted to hear M_that . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1285,She sipped her tea .
ac2-fragment06,1286,‰Û÷ Next ‰Û_
ac2-fragment06,1287,I 've found a super husband for Harriet .
ac2-fragment06,1288,M_Champion of the breed M_at Crufts last year .
ac2-fragment06,1289,"Lives in the next village , believe it or not ."
ac2-fragment06,1290,Absolutely magnificent dog . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1291,"‰Û÷ Lucky Harriet , ‰Ûª said Mark ."
ac2-fragment06,1292,‰Û÷ What else ?
ac2-fragment06,1293,Ah yes ; a Secretary M_at the Ministry of Industry wants you to ring him .
ac2-fragment06,1294,Seems they want you to M_address the European Commission M_on European industrial development .
ac2-fragment06,1295,"In Dublin , I think she said ."
ac2-fragment06,1296,Something M_about the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions .
ac2-fragment06,1297,"Anyway , you 'll know what it M_means when you see it ."
ac2-fragment06,1298,I 've written it all M_down .
ac2-fragment06,1299,Oh and yes ‰Û_ a chap M_from Conservative M_Central Office rang up to say they 'd like to know if you would be M_prepared to M_stand for the European Parliament .
ac2-fragment06,1300,He sounded somewhat M_to the M_right of Genghis Khan .
ac2-fragment06,1301,"I said I did n't think so , as you were rather busy , but I 'd M_pass the message M_on ."
ac2-fragment06,1302,Hope I did the right M_thing .
ac2-fragment06,1303,I said you never knew where you were M_from one week M_to the next .
ac2-fragment06,1304,He said M_that would do nicely .
ac2-fragment06,1305,Just like the American Express advertisement .
ac2-fragment06,1306,"Perfect credentials apparently , for European parliamentarians ."
ac2-fragment06,1307,‰Û÷ Now what next ?
ac2-fragment06,1308,The Chicheley-Smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in Sardinia and say we could rent it if we 'd like to .
ac2-fragment06,1309,I 've seen the photographs .
ac2-fragment06,1310,Gorgeous location M_overlooking a M_quiet bay .
ac2-fragment06,1311,It sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three .
ac2-fragment06,1312,"Only a thousand pounds a week , yacht M_included ."
ac2-fragment06,1313,"I 'd love M_that for two or three weeks , would n't you ? ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1314,"‰Û÷ We would n't want to stint ourselves , ‰Ûª Mark said facetiously , ‰Û÷ four or five , I should think ‰Û_ . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1315,"‰Û÷ And we could take the family , ‰Ûª she said ."
ac2-fragment06,1316,‰Û÷ We have n't M_had a family holiday for years .
ac2-fragment06,1317,I 'd like M_that .
ac2-fragment06,1318,But we can talk M_about M_that later .
ac2-fragment06,1319,And I 've decided to M_take M_up riding again .
ac2-fragment06,1320,Do n't ask me why .
ac2-fragment06,1321,"Just M_got the urge , M_that 's all . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1322,"She M_gave him a beautiful smile , which M_lit her lovely face ."
ac2-fragment06,1323,"‰Û÷ Well , how 's M_that for M_starters ? ‰Ûª she asked ."
ac2-fragment06,1324,He had heard M_that expression M_before .
ac2-fragment06,1325,"‰Û÷ Is there more ? ,"
ac2-fragment06,1326,‰Û÷ Now let me M_see .
ac2-fragment06,1327,"Ah , yes ‰Û_"
ac2-fragment06,1328,Andrew 's coming home for the weekend so I thought it would be nice to M_have a drinks party .
ac2-fragment06,1329,"I 've invited the Bunkers , if M_that 's all right ."
ac2-fragment06,1330,I like Clem and Gwen and the girls would be nicer company for Andrew . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1331,"‰Û÷ Fine , ‰Ûª agreed Mark M_without much enthusiasm ."
ac2-fragment06,1332,"‰Û÷ If Clem can M_make M_it , that is ."
ac2-fragment06,1333,I heard M_about M_this latest Merseyside M_strike in Istanbul .
ac2-fragment06,1334,"Could M_finish M_off the UK vehicle division , ‰Ûª he said forlornly , ‰Û÷ and Don Peters , ‰Ûª he M_added , shaking his head ."
ac2-fragment06,1335,Some of the stupid bastards wo n't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the UK .
ac2-fragment06,1336,"Then I suppose they 'll say it 's all management 's fault , and people will believe them ."
ac2-fragment06,1337,"And who the hell IS management ? ‰Ûª he demanded , his voice M_rising ."
ac2-fragment06,1338,"‰Û÷ People like me , who 've worked their M_guts M_out to M_expand the business while the militant M_bastards have been working their M_guts M_out to M_destroy it . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1339,Georgina was nodding agreement .
ac2-fragment06,1340,She patted his wrist .
ac2-fragment06,1341,"‰Û÷ I 'm quite sure you 're right , dear ."
ac2-fragment06,1342,But we were n't talking M_about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union M_saga .
ac2-fragment06,1343,We were talking M_about Andrew coming home for the weekend and M_having the Bunkers M_round for drinks .
ac2-fragment06,1344,And I do wish you would n't swear like M_that when you talk M_about business .
ac2-fragment06,1345,"You never used to swear , you know ."
ac2-fragment06,1346,"At least , you did n't when you were with me ."
ac2-fragment06,1347,"But you do now , darling , and I do wish you would n't ."
ac2-fragment06,1348,You are becoming so M_hard and M_bitter and it 's not really like you . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1349,Mark sighed .
ac2-fragment06,1350,‰Û÷ I 'm sorry .
ac2-fragment06,1351,It 's just ‰Û_ . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1352,"‰Û÷ It 's just that there really is trouble at t'mill , ‰Ûª she said quietly ."
ac2-fragment06,1353,"‰Û÷ M_That 's it , is n't it ?"
ac2-fragment06,1354,You were n't going to tell me .
ac2-fragment06,1355,You were just going to worry M_about it alone .
ac2-fragment06,1356,You let me M_go rabitting M_on ‰Û_ .
ac2-fragment06,1357,He hugged her ; kissed her cheek .
ac2-fragment06,1358,‰Û÷ I 'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry M_about . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1359,‰Û÷ But you think there is . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1360,He nodded .
ac2-fragment06,1361,"‰Û÷ I M_have a horrible feeling that UM is M_about to reorganise world-wide M_planning M_operations and , if M_that happens , it 's M_curtains for the European organisation and for me . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1362,‰Û÷ Curtains ? ‰Ûª she said .
ac2-fragment06,1363,‰Û÷ What exactly would M_that M_mean ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1364,‰Û÷ Early retirement . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1365,"‰Û÷ Mark , you 're not serious ! ,"
ac2-fragment06,1366,‰Û÷ I think it could be M_on the M_cards .
ac2-fragment06,1367,"They could transfer me to Detroit , or somewhere ."
ac2-fragment06,1368,"I do n't know , but I do n't like the M_signs . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1369,"‰Û÷ Oh , Mark , ‰Ûª she said ."
ac2-fragment06,1370,‰Û÷ They would n't do that M_to you .
ac2-fragment06,1371,They just could n't .
ac2-fragment06,1372,Not M_after all you 've done for the Corporation .
ac2-fragment06,1373,They could n't be that unfair and ruthless . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1374,His expression was wry .
ac2-fragment06,1375,"‰Û÷ My dear , they 'll do whatever they M_feel is necessary to do ."
ac2-fragment06,1376,"Sentiment , loyalty , service and M_track record , none of M_these M_things will M_come M_into it . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1377,Georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips .
ac2-fragment06,1378,"‰Û÷ It 's all so ridiculous that we 're not going to even think M_about it any more , ‰Ûª she said M_firmly , M_hiding her fears ."
ac2-fragment06,1379,"‰Û÷ Now come into the garden , ‰Ûª she M_added , smiling ."
ac2-fragment06,1380,‰Û÷ I want to show you the clematis .
ac2-fragment06,1381,It 's a M_mass of colour . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1382,"Lying in bed M_that evening , they talked a lot M_about their life together ."
ac2-fragment06,1383,They M_recalled their first days .
ac2-fragment06,1384,The county ball .
ac2-fragment06,1385,The Paul Jones and the emotional M_somersaults when the music M_stopped and they M_came face to face for the very first time .
ac2-fragment06,1386,The wedding .
ac2-fragment06,1387,"The birth of their first son , Adam , and then Christopher and Andrew ."
ac2-fragment06,1388,The children growing up M_with all the laughter and tears .
ac2-fragment06,1389,"Schooldays and the M_void they both M_felt when the boys went off to boarding school , followed by the joy M_unconfined when they came home M_at the M_end of term ."
ac2-fragment06,1390,Mark 's promotions and progress M_up the company M_ladder .
ac2-fragment06,1391,New and changing homes .
ac2-fragment06,1392,Friends lost and friends M_gained .
ac2-fragment06,1393,Family achievements and disappointments .
ac2-fragment06,1394,"Notwithstanding current problems which they discussed M_lightly , it had all been wonderful ."
ac2-fragment06,1395,"They M_fell asleep M_in the early hours of the morning , holding hands ."
ac2-fragment06,1396,The next day Mark arrived M_back at UM 's European M_headquarters in London and received an early call M_from Muldoon .
ac2-fragment06,1397,"He went M_down the airless corridor to his Boss 's office , said hello M_to the secretary , and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel ."
ac2-fragment06,1398,"Muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him , coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched ."
ac2-fragment06,1399,‰Û÷ Hello Mark .
ac2-fragment06,1400,M_Have a good trip ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1401,He took the Englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table .
ac2-fragment06,1402,"Instinctively , Mark M_felt uneasy ."
ac2-fragment06,1403,Why the hand on the arm and the M_over-friendly M_approach ?
ac2-fragment06,1404,Muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues .
ac2-fragment06,1405,Only visitors and VIPs M_got M_that special M_reception .
ac2-fragment06,1406,Muldoon poured the coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1407,‰Û÷ How did the M_Planning meeting M_go ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1408,Mark asked him .
ac2-fragment06,1409,‰Û÷ What was Nate 's M_reaction ?
ac2-fragment06,1410,Did he and the Committee go along with my proposals ? ‰Ûª he M_added .
ac2-fragment06,1411,"‰Û÷ It M_went fine , ‰Ûª Muldoon said ."
ac2-fragment06,1412,He seemed somewhat uneasy .
ac2-fragment06,1413,‰Û÷ Klepner did a good M_job . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1414,‰Û÷ How did he M_handle the questions ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1415,Mark asked .
ac2-fragment06,1416,‰Û÷ He does n't M_have the M_inside knowledge to M_deal M_with questions . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1417,"‰Û÷ Oh , OK really ."
ac2-fragment06,1418,I M_handled some and so did Mueller .
ac2-fragment06,1419,But Klepner did OK .
ac2-fragment06,1420,He did n't M_let the M_side M_down . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1421,Mark nodded .
ac2-fragment06,1422,‰Û÷ What was Mueller doing answering questions .
ac2-fragment06,1423,He was there to ASK them .
ac2-fragment06,1424,He does n't know the M_inside M_track any more than Klepner . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1425,"‰Û÷ Maybe not , but he soon will , ‰Ûª Muldoon replied quietly ."
ac2-fragment06,1426,‰Û÷ And what does M_that M_mean ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1427,Muldoon seemed to be M_taking a M_long time M_over his coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1428,He M_evaded Mark 's eyes .
ac2-fragment06,1429,‰Û÷ He 's goin' to M_head-up world M_planning operations from Detroit . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1430,‰Û÷ He 's already M_co-ordinating the regional M_plans to provide a world M_picture .
ac2-fragment06,1431,So what 's changed ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1432,M_Deep M_down he knew .
ac2-fragment06,1433,"‰Û÷ He 's not going to just M_co-ordinate and consolidate any longer , ‰Ûª Muldoon said , with M_increasing nervousness ."
ac2-fragment06,1434,"‰Û÷ He 's gon na M_plan , M_direct and control worldwide M_planning operations from Detroit , M_including the regional M_planning functions . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1435,Mark 's expression was one of M_faked incredulity .
ac2-fragment06,1436,His M_gut feelings had been right .
ac2-fragment06,1437,‰Û÷ You 've got to be joking ! ‰Ûª he scoffed .
ac2-fragment06,1438,"‰Û÷ I know M_that 's what Mueller 's always wanted , but Nate and the Executive Committee would never M_fall for M_that M_bloody empire-building M_game !"
ac2-fragment06,1439,The regions are M_far too big and complex to be M_handled from Detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively ‰ÛÓ which they ca n't ‰ÛÓ they would be crazy to try . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1440,"‰Û÷ I know , Mark , I know , ‰Ûª Muldoon said ."
ac2-fragment06,1441,‰Û÷ But M_that 's what they 're gon na do . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1442,"‰Û÷ It will boomerang , ‰Ûª the Englishman said M_heatedly ."
ac2-fragment06,1443,"‰Û÷ Overseas Governments and local nationals just wo n't M_stand for it , particularly when they M_get to M_know what 's M_going M_on ."
ac2-fragment06,1444,"M_That 's one M_corporate M_plan that ca n't M_win , not M_in the M_long term ."
ac2-fragment06,1445,"‰Û÷ I know , Mark ."
ac2-fragment06,1446,But they think they can M_run everything from Detroit and M_that 's the M_way the organisation is going to be restructured .
ac2-fragment06,1447,They are working M_on it right now .
ac2-fragment06,1448,We will know the details M_in a few weeks ‰Ûª time .
ac2-fragment06,1449,Couple of months M_at the latest . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1450,Mark said quietly :
ac2-fragment06,1451,‰Û÷ And how does M_that affect the European organisation ?
ac2-fragment06,1452,‰Û÷ The organisation will be M_wound M_up .
ac2-fragment06,1453,I 'm M_taking early retirement . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1454,‰Û÷ And me ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1455,Muldoon shrugged .
ac2-fragment06,1456,‰Û÷ Not certain yet .
ac2-fragment06,1457,"But my guess is early retirement too , unless you 're M_prepared to go back M_to divisional work ."
ac2-fragment06,1458,Local MD perhaps ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1459,The Englishman snorted .
ac2-fragment06,1460,‰Û÷ You know I ca n't go back .
ac2-fragment06,1461,Who the hell can ?
ac2-fragment06,1462,"M_In any case , you know as well as I do that the MDs are always American . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1463,"‰Û÷ Well , there wo n't be any European job functions , M_that 's for sure , ‰Ûª Muldoon said ."
ac2-fragment06,1464,"‰Û÷ There 'll be a M_direct M_link M_between Detroit and the line managers in each country , M_with Detroit M_calling the M_shots . ‰Ûª"
ac2-fragment06,1465,‰Û÷ Do n't they realise they 're M_playing M_with political M_dynamite ?
ac2-fragment06,1466,Mark demanded .
ac2-fragment06,1467,‰Û÷ Mueller wo n't M_give a damn M_about the effect of a M_corporate M_plan M_on Europe and M_on individual countries .
ac2-fragment06,1468,"If he wants to import vehicles or components from Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong into Europe , he 'll M_go M_ahead and do it , regardless of the economic consequences for the European countries concerned ."
ac2-fragment06,1469,The only M_thing you can be sure of is that US interest will always M_come first .
ac2-fragment06,1470,"Oh , and there 's one more M_thing you can be sure of , ‰Ûª he M_added M_sourly ."
ac2-fragment06,1471,‰Û÷ They wo n't M_plan to supply the US M_market M_from imports .
ac2-fragment06,1472,You can bet your M_bottom dollar M_on M_that !
ac2-fragment06,1473,"Jesus wept ! ‰Ûª he continued , M_hackles M_rising ."
ac2-fragment06,1474,‰Û÷ Mueller will M_have the M_power to M_make or M_break whole areas of Europe .
ac2-fragment06,1475,He 's the last guy in the world who should be M_given such M_power .
ac2-fragment06,1476,The M_bloody man 's M_power M_drunk already . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1477,He was angry and M_bitter .
ac2-fragment06,1478,"‰Û÷ I know , ‰Ûª Muldoon agreed sadly ."
ac2-fragment06,1479,‰Û÷ Then what are you and Clancy doing M_about it ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1480,"‰Û÷ M_Look , Mark , ‰Ûª Muldoon said forlornly ‰Û÷ What 's the M_point ?"
ac2-fragment06,1481,The M_wheels have already been M_set M_in M_motion .
ac2-fragment06,1482,We 're not gon na M_change anyone 's mind .
ac2-fragment06,1483,You know M_that . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1484,His tone was abject .
ac2-fragment06,1485,"‰Û÷ Sorry you 're M_takin' it so bad , ‰Ûª he M_added miserably ."
ac2-fragment06,1486,‰Û÷ How else should I M_take it ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1487,Mark demanded .
ac2-fragment06,1488,‰Û÷ It 's my life which is M_about to M_go M_down the M_plughole .
ac2-fragment06,1489,I 'm not an American M_on a M_brief overseas assignment .
ac2-fragment06,1490,I 've M_spent my entire working life M_in the European components ‰Ûª business .
ac2-fragment06,1491,I 've M_grown M_up M_in it .
ac2-fragment06,1492,It 's in M_my M_blood .
ac2-fragment06,1493,I 've built M_plants and managed them .
ac2-fragment06,1494,Designed products and marketed and sold them .
ac2-fragment06,1495,"When I was an apprentice there were two component M_plants in Europe , and now there are seventeen , and I 've M_had a M_hand M_in establishing the last twelve ."
ac2-fragment06,1496,What the hell do you expect me to say ?
ac2-fragment06,1497,"Oh , is M_that what they are proposing to do ?"
ac2-fragment06,1498,Well M_bully for Mueller and the Corporation ?
ac2-fragment06,1499,I 'll M_go and M_collect my M_hat and M_coat ! ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1500,"‰Û÷ I know how you M_feel , Mark , ‰Ûª Muldoon said sadly ."
ac2-fragment06,1501,"‰Û÷ Do you , Pat ?"
ac2-fragment06,1502,Do you ?
ac2-fragment06,1503,You 're sixty-one and have been M_looking M_forward M_to retirement .
ac2-fragment06,1504,I 'm fifty and M_have a M_long M_way to go .
ac2-fragment06,1505,I do n't think you can M_see M_things the M_way I M_see them .
ac2-fragment06,1506,"‰Û÷ Well , perhaps not , ‰Ûª Muldoon agreed ."
ac2-fragment06,1507,‰Û÷ But I can understand how you M_feel . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1508,The Englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee .
ac2-fragment06,1509,‰Û÷ So what 's going to happen M_to the European M_Plan ? ‰Ûª he asked .
ac2-fragment06,1510,"‰Û÷ Mueller will M_drive it from Detroit , M_with one or two amendments agreed M_at the EPC meeting , ‰Ûª Muldoon told him ."
ac2-fragment06,1511,‰Û÷ What amendments ? ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1512,‰Û÷ No further M_plant investment in the UK . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1513,"‰Û÷ I suppose Mueller M_saw M_to M_that , ‰Ûª Mark said sarcastically ."
ac2-fragment06,1514,‰Û÷ He really hates our M_guts !
ac2-fragment06,1515,God help the British M_plants M_under the new M_regime ! ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1516,Muldoon shook his head .
ac2-fragment06,1517,"‰Û÷ No , it was n't M_that ."
ac2-fragment06,1518,It was the M_strike at Merseyside .
ac2-fragment06,1519,M_That was the last M_straw as M_far as Nate was concerned .
ac2-fragment06,1520,"Up until M_that news M_hit the Committee , Don had won the day M_with his UK Vehicle Division proposals ."
ac2-fragment06,1521,"But as soon as Nate heard M_about the latest M_strike , M_that was it ."
ac2-fragment06,1522,M_End of M_story .
ac2-fragment06,1523,He instructed Mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the UK . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1524,Mark nodded .
ac2-fragment06,1525,‰Û÷ How did Don M_take it ?
ac2-fragment06,1526,He was beginning to win through . ‰Ûª
ac2-fragment06,1527,‰Û÷ He 's very upset .
ac2-fragment06,1528,Naturally .
ac2-fragment06,1529,It 's the first time M_in his career he has n't M_come M_out M_on M_top .

acj-fragment01,1,HOMICIDE
acj-fragment01,2,M_This chapter M_deals M_with the M_approach of the criminal law M_to behaviour which causes or M_risks causing death .
acj-fragment01,3,"Murder , manslaughter , and several other offences are M_discussed , and one recurrent issue M_here is whether English law M_responds M_proportionately M_to the different M_degrees of culpability manifested M_in cases M_where death is caused ."
acj-fragment01,4,7.1 DEATH AND FINALITY
acj-fragment01,5,"For practical purposes , the M_culpable causing of another person 's death may fairly be M_regarded as the most M_serious offence M_in the criminal M_calendar ."
acj-fragment01,6,"There is an argument that treason is a more M_serious offence , since it M_strikes M_at the very M_foundations of the State and its social organizations , but treason is so M_rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most M_serious M_form of crime ."
acj-fragment01,7,"The reason for M_this is not difficult to M_find : the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable M_to a M_degree , whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable ."
acj-fragment01,8,"Even M_in crimes of violence which M_leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects , the victim M_retains his or her life and , therefore , the possibility of further pleasures and achievements , whereas death is final ."
acj-fragment01,9,"M_This finality M_makes it proper to M_regard death as the most M_serious harm that may be inflicted M_on another , and to M_regard a person who chooses to inflict M_that harm as the most culpable of offenders , M_in the absence of some excuse or justification ."
acj-fragment01,10,"Although many deaths M_arise M_from natural causes , and many others M_from illnesses and diseases , each year M_sees a M_large number of deaths caused by ‰Û÷ accidents ‰Ûª , and also a number caused by acts or omissions which M_amount M_to some M_form of homicide M_in English law ."
acj-fragment01,11,"For 1987 the statistics M_show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths , of which some 7,000 occurred in the home , 6,000 M_at work , and 5,000 on the roads ."
acj-fragment01,12,"By comparison , the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600 , which M_includes all the murders and manslaughters ."
acj-fragment01,13,"M_This figure is relatively M_small when compared M_with many American cities , but M_that is no cause for satisfaction ."
acj-fragment01,14,There are still awkward questions to be M_confronted .
acj-fragment01,15,"For example , are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are M_in fact more M_culpable than all , or even most , of the deaths recorded as accidents ?"
acj-fragment01,16,"M_In other words , does English criminal law M_pick M_out the most heinous M_forms of killing as murders and manslaughters , or are the M_boundaries M_frozen by tradition ?"
acj-fragment01,17,Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be M_wider M_in its M_application M_to activities which M_carry some risk of causing death than M_in other M_spheres .
acj-fragment01,18,"Thus , even if it would be excessive to M_sweep M_large numbers of the deaths now recorded as ‰Û÷ accidents ‰Ûª M_into the law of homicide , there may be sufficient justification for M_creating or enforcing offences M_designed to ensure safe conditions of work , safe goods , safe buildings , and so on ."
acj-fragment01,19,It was argued M_in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to M_spread its M_net M_wider M_where the potential harm is M_greater .
acj-fragment01,20,"It will be M_seen that English law M_does M_this M_up M_to a M_point , and M_in the process seems to M_accept M_social-defence arguments as reasons for M_departing M_from several of the principles M_set M_out in Chapter 3 ."
acj-fragment01,21,7.2 REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE
acj-fragment01,22,"English law M_distinguishes M_between the offences of murder and manslaughter , as we shall see , but the two crimes do M_have certain common M_elements ."
acj-fragment01,23,It must be proved that the defendant 's act or omission caused the death of the victim M_within a year and a day .
acj-fragment01,24,( The requirements of causation M_in the criminal law are M_discussed M_elsewhere . )
acj-fragment01,25,"The ‰Û÷ year and a day ‰Ûª M_rule is a M_legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that , if there was a M_substantial lapse of time M_between injury and death , it was unsafe to M_pronounce M_on whether the defendant 's conduct or some other event caused the death ."
acj-fragment01,26,"Nowadays the problem is quite the M_reverse : medical science is generally M_able to M_determine whether D's conduct caused the death , and innovations such as M_life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years M_in some instances ."
acj-fragment01,27,"M_In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a M_half years M_after the incident , having been M_kept M_on a M_life-support machine for almost the entire time ."
acj-fragment01,28,"M_In principle , it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible M_in such a case , if all the other M_elements can be established and only the ‰Û÷ year and a day ‰Ûª M_rule M_stands M_in the M_way ."
acj-fragment01,29,"But the M_rule was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee M_in 1980 , M_on the M_ground that a defendant should not be M_left M_in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely ."
acj-fragment01,30,Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years M_after the event .
acj-fragment01,31,The M_rule itself is M_out of accord M_with modern medical conditions and should be abolished .
acj-fragment01,32,M_DEFINING MURDER : THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION
acj-fragment01,33,( a ) The Procedural M_Context
acj-fragment01,34,"If causing death is to be M_regarded as the most M_serious harm that can be inflicted , it would seem to M_follow that the most blameworthy M_form of homicide should result M_in the M_highest sentences M_imposed by the courts ."
acj-fragment01,35,"Indeed , many M_systems of criminal law M_impose a mandatory sentence for murder ( or whatever the M_highest M_form of homicide is M_called M_in M_that M_system ) ."
acj-fragment01,36,M_In some jurisdictions M_this is a mandatory sentence of death .
acj-fragment01,37,"M_In others , such as M_those in the United Kingdom , it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment ."
acj-fragment01,38,"Why should M_this penalty be mandatory , and not M_at the discretion of the court as M_in other offences ?"
acj-fragment01,39,One argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it M_amounts M_to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder .
acj-fragment01,40,"It M_places the offender M_under the State 's control , as it were , for the remainder of his or her life ."
acj-fragment01,41,"M_This is often M_linked M_with a supposed denunciatory effect ‰ÛÓ the idea that the mandatory life sentence M_denounces murder as emphatically as possible ‰ÛÓ and M_with a supposed general deterrent effect , M_in M_declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for M_this crime ."
acj-fragment01,42,It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence M_makes a M_substantial M_contribution to public safety .
acj-fragment01,43,"None of M_these arguments is notably M_strong , let alone conclusive ."
acj-fragment01,44,"The mandatory penalty does indeed M_serve to M_mark M_out murder M_from other crimes , but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently M_refined to M_capture the worst killings , and only the worst killings , M_remains to be M_discussed M_below ."
acj-fragment01,45,"Whether the life sentence is M_regarded as a sufficient denunciation M_in society depends M_on the public 's M_perception of what life imprisonment means : if it is widely believed that it results M_in an average of nine years ' imprisonment , the effect will be somewhat M_blunted ."
acj-fragment01,46,"The same applies M_to the general deterrent argument : its effectiveness depends M_on whether the penalty for murder affects the M_calculations of potential killers at all , and , if it does , whether life imprisonment is M_seen as significantly more or less M_severe than the alternative of a M_long , M_fixed-term sentence ."
acj-fragment01,47,"As for public protection , M_this depends M_on executive decisions with regard to release ; it M_fails to M_take M_into M_account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep ‰Û÷ lifers ‰Ûª in for so M_long ."
acj-fragment01,48,"M_This M_brings the M_discussion M_to a crucial M_point : what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean M_in practice , and what would be the alternative ?"
acj-fragment01,49,"What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the M_Home Secretary , M_on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice , rather than by the judge at the trial ."
acj-fragment01,50,"M_In procedural terms , therefore , the life sentence involves a M_transfer of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence ( or at least its M_upper M_limit , since earlier release M_on parole may be possible ) , whereas a life sentence M_entrusts M_that function M_to the executive , who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge ."
acj-fragment01,51,"The Home Office is not M_bound by M_those opinions , and appears to M_depart M_from them frequently ."
acj-fragment01,52,"M_In 1983 the M_Home Secretary imposed restrictions M_on the release of persons M_serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers , terrorist killings , murder during robbery , and the M_sadistic or sexual murder of young children , M_fixing a minimum of twenty years ' imprisonment for M_these offenders ."
acj-fragment01,53,"Whatever the justifications for M_introducing M_this policy , it M_serves to M_underline the fact that sentencing M_in murder cases is M_enacted M_without each case being M_considered M_individually , M_after hearing representations M_from the offender 's counsel , and M_without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal ."
acj-fragment01,54,"At present , the executive M_takes decisions to release some murderers M_after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely M_long periods ."
acj-fragment01,55,"Should M_those decisions not be M_taken by the courts , M_in the same M_way as other sentencing decisions ?"
acj-fragment01,56,The answer sometimes M_given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous : anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again .
acj-fragment01,57,"But M_this argument will seem less M_persuasive when we have M_discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility : M_where a murder is M_reduced M_to manslaughter , the judge has a M_wide sentencing discretion and may , according to the facts of the case , select a determinate prison sentence , a hospital order , or life imprisonment ."
acj-fragment01,58,"M_Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than M_those convicted of murder , and yet the judge M_has sentencing discretion M_in one case and not M_in the other ."
acj-fragment01,59,Considerations of M_this kind have M_led the House of Lords Select Committee M_on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder .
acj-fragment01,60,"M_In its M_place would be a sentencing discretion , which judges would use , M_in many cases , to M_mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence ."
acj-fragment01,61,"M_In cases M_where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence , the trial judge would still specify ‰ÛÓ in M_open court ‰ÛÓ the number of years to be M_spent in prison , M_taking the M_gravity of the offence M_into M_account , and release would be M_determined by a judicial tribunal ."
acj-fragment01,62,Such a reform would M_bring improvements M_in natural justice M_without M_loss of public protection .
acj-fragment01,63,( b ) M_Degrees of Homicide
acj-fragment01,64,"English criminal law M_has two M_degrees of homicide , murder and manslaughter ."
acj-fragment01,65,"Many American jurisdictions M_have three M_degrees of murder ‰ÛÓ M_first-degree murder , requiring premeditation , and second- and M_third-degree murder , M_covering lesser M_shades of culpability ."
acj-fragment01,66,"In England there has been a proposal that we should do away M_with all M_these distinctions , M_leaving a single offence of criminal homicide ."
acj-fragment01,67,"M_That proposal , if implemented , would M_shift almost all the decision-making M_in homicide cases M_from the trial M_to the sentencing M_stage : the only issue of any consequence M_in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed , and all the distinctions now M_drawn M_at the M_stage of criminal liability would be M_reflected M_in the sentence alone ."
acj-fragment01,68,"The jury would M_have no M_role M_in most homicide cases , since a plea of guilty would be the norm ."
acj-fragment01,69,"Contrast M_this M_with the M_position M_in jurisdictions M_where there are three or more M_degrees of homicide : pleas of guilty M_to first- and M_second-degree murders would be less frequent , since there would be the possibility of argument in court ( if no M_bargain was M_struck beforehand M_between prosecution and defence ) , and the defence might M_succeed M_in persuading the jury to M_reduce the M_degree of the killing ."
acj-fragment01,70,"Moreover , the M_borderlines M_between the various M_degrees would M_raise questions of law , which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals ."
acj-fragment01,71,"The result would be that killings were classified and M_labelled M_in a more M_refined M_way , but M_at the M_cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid M_bills ."
acj-fragment01,72,M_That M_cost is not difficult to justify M_where M_capital punishment is the penalty for M_first-degree murder .
acj-fragment01,73,"M_Where there is no capital punishment , however , the question of how many M_degrees of homicide it is desirable to M_have M_calls for M_careful M_weighing of the principle of fair M_labelling ( see Chapter 3.3 ( l ) ) M_against the M_cost and time arguments M_mobilised by the policy of efficient administration ( see Chapter 3.3 ( m ) ) ."
acj-fragment01,74,The M_structure of the English law of homicide is rather strange .
acj-fragment01,75,"Although there are two offences , murder and manslaughter , the latter M_includes two M_distinct varieties : ‰Û÷ voluntary ‰Ûª manslaughter ( killings which would be murder but for the existence of M_defined extenuating circumstances ) ; and ‰Û÷ involuntary ‰Ûª manslaughter ( killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused , but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability ) ."
acj-fragment01,76,The arguments therefore M_tend to M_focus M_on three borderline questions : What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder ?
acj-fragment01,77,What conditions are needed to M_reduce murder to manslaughter ?
acj-fragment01,78,And what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter .
acj-fragment01,79,( c ) Requirements for Murder
acj-fragment01,80,"M_In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder : an intent to kill , or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ."
acj-fragment01,81,What do M_these requirements mean ?
acj-fragment01,82,"Do they M_extend the definition of murder too M_far , or are they too M_narrow ."
acj-fragment01,83,"Intent to kill may be M_regarded as the most obvious and indisputable M_form of fault M_element for murder , but M_to some M_extent M_that depends M_on the meaning of ‰Û÷ intent ‰Ûª ."
acj-fragment01,84,"M_This has been the M_subject of a number of House of Lords decisions , and yet the definition is still not M_clear and M_settled ."
acj-fragment01,85,"Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission M_charged , or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to M_follow M_from M_that act or omission ."
acj-fragment01,86,"M_In M_this M_way , both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are M_regarded as M_part of the definition of intent , although there are other statements M_suggesting that foresight of practical or ‰Û÷ virtual ‰Ûª certainty is merely evidence M_from which intent may be inferred ."
acj-fragment01,87,How would M_this test be M_applied ?
acj-fragment01,88,"In many cases the word ‰Û÷ intent ‰Ûª is used M_without elaboration , but there are some for which a M_full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary ."
acj-fragment01,89,"A fairly typical M_set of facts is provided by Nedrick ( 1986 ) , M_where D M_had a grudge M_against a woman and had threatened to ‰Û÷ burn her out ‰Ûª ."
acj-fragment01,90,"One night he went to her house , poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door , and M_set it alight ."
acj-fragment01,91,One of the woman 's children died in the ensuing fire .
acj-fragment01,92,"When asked why he did it , D replied : ‰Û÷ Just to wake her up and frighten her . ‰Ûª"
acj-fragment01,93,"A M_defence of M_this kind , a M_claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm , requires the full definition to be M_put M_to the jury ."
acj-fragment01,94,"The question is : granted that D's purpose was to frighten , did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm M_to someone ?"
acj-fragment01,95,The jury should answer M_this by M_drawing inferences M_from the evidence M_in the case and M_from the M_surrounding circumstances .
acj-fragment01,96,"What M_about the alternative M_element M_in the definition , an intent to cause grievous bodily harm ?"
acj-fragment01,97,"M_This M_has considerable practical importance , since M_this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder ."
acj-fragment01,98,"It must be M_shown that the defendant intended ( which , again , M_includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty ) to cause really serious injury M_to someone ."
acj-fragment01,99,"The House of Lords M_confirmed M_this M_rule M_in Cunningham ( 1981 ) : D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair , causing injuries M_from which the victim died a week later ."
acj-fragment01,100,"D M_maintained M_throughout that he had not intended to kill , but there was evidence M_from which the jury could infer ‰ÛÓ and did infer ‰ÛÓ that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm ."
acj-fragment01,101,"The House of Lords M_upheld D 's conviction for murder : an intent to cause really M_serious injury is sufficient for murder , M_without any proof that the defendant intended , or even M_contemplated , the possibility that death would result ."
acj-fragment01,102,Does the ‰Û÷ grievous bodily harm ‰Ûª M_rule M_extend the definition of murder too M_far ?
acj-fragment01,103,"If the M_point of distinguishing murder M_from manslaughter is to M_mark M_out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction , it can be argued that the ‰Û÷ grievous bodily harm ‰Ûª M_rule M_draws the M_line too M_low ."
acj-fragment01,104,"In terms of principle , the M_rule requires justification because M_it M_departs M_from the principle of correspondence ( see Chapter 5.2(a) ) , namely that the fault M_element M_in a crime should relate M_to the consequences prohibited by M_that crime ."
acj-fragment01,105,"By M_allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction , the law is M_violating a general principle , M_turning the most M_serious of its offences M_into a M_constructive crime ."
acj-fragment01,106,Why should it be necessary to ‰Û÷ M_construct ‰Ûª a murder conviction out of M_this lesser intent ?
acj-fragment01,107,"There are arguments in favour of M_this : death is M_final , murder is the gravest crime , and there is no M_significant moral difference M_between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who M_sets M_out to kill ."
acj-fragment01,108,"No one can predict whether a serious injury will result M_in death ‰ÛÓ M_that may depend M_on the victim 's physique , M_on the speed of an ambulance , M_on the distance from the hospital , and M_on a M_range of other medical and individual matters ."
acj-fragment01,109,"If one person chooses to cause M_serious injury M_to another , it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death , and such cases M_show a sufficiently M_wanton disregard for life as to warrant the M_label ‰Û÷ murder ‰Ûª if death results ."
acj-fragment01,110,"The counter-arguments , which would M_uphold the principle of correspondence , are that M_breach of M_that principle is unnecessary when the M_amplitude of the crime of manslaughter M_lies M_beneath murder , and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm M_includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to M_put the victim 's life M_at risk ."
acj-fragment01,111,"M_In the M_leading case of Cunningham Lord Edmund-Davies ( dissenting ) M_gave the example of breaking someone 's arm : M_that is a really M_serious injury , but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim 's life ."
acj-fragment01,112,So M_in practice the ‰Û÷ grievous bodily harm ‰Ûª M_rule M_goes M_further than the arguments of its M_protagonists would M_support .
acj-fragment01,113,"Would it be right , then , to M_confine the fault M_element M_in murder M_to an intent to kill ?"
acj-fragment01,114,"M_That would M_have the merit of simplicity , but would it M_strike the right M_note socially ?"
acj-fragment01,115,"There are M_powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings M_where an intent to kill can not be established , and yet M_where the moral or social culpability is equal M_to M_that M_in most intentional killings ."
acj-fragment01,116,"Of course , one can not be adamant M_about whether they merit the M_label ‰Û÷ murder ‰Ûª , because M_that is a question of M_drawing the M_line M_between murder and manslaughter , which is not susceptible of any precise resolution ."
acj-fragment01,117,It is M_hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be M_smaller or M_larger ( unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence M_follows ) ; it is a question of social judgment .
acj-fragment01,118,Let us briefly M_consider some of the possibilities .
acj-fragment01,119,The fault M_element for many M_serious offences is intent or recklessness : why should M_this not suffice for murder ?
acj-fragment01,120,The question is whether all killings M_in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently M_serious to warrant the term ‰Û÷ murder ‰Ûª .
acj-fragment01,121,"One answer sometimes M_given is that they are not , because a driver who overtakes on a bend , knowingly M_taking the risk that there is a car travelling M_in the M_opposite direction , should not be M_labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue ."
acj-fragment01,122,M_This example M_assumes that a sympathy for motorists M_with M_overwhelm any tendency M_to logical analysis .
acj-fragment01,123,One might ask whether motorists are ever justified M_in knowingly M_taking risks M_with other people 's lives .
acj-fragment01,124,"Yet if the example is M_modified a little , so that the overtaking is on a country road M_at night and the risk is known to be M_slight , it becomes questionable whether the causing of death M_in M_these circumstances should be M_labelled M_in the same M_way as intentional killings ."
acj-fragment01,125,M_This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently .
acj-fragment01,126,"The M_point is rather that , even though knowingly M_taking risks M_with other people 's lives is usually unjustifiable , M_taking a M_slight risk is less M_serious than intentionally causing death ."
acj-fragment01,127,"M_In M_discussing the M_boundaries of murder , we are concerned M_with classification , not exculpation ."
acj-fragment01,128,"To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too M_broad , but the M_point M_remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings ."
acj-fragment01,129,Can a satisfactory M_line be M_drawn M_here ?
acj-fragment01,130,One M_approach would be to M_draw the M_line by reference M_to the M_degree of probability .
acj-fragment01,131,Murder is committed M_in M_those M_situations M_where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result .
acj-fragment01,132,A version of M_this test of foresight of M_high probability is used in several other European countries ; it was M_introduced M_into English law by the decision M_in Hyam v.
acj-fragment01,133,"DPP ( 1975 ) , but M_abandoned M_in Moloney ( 1985 ) M_on M_grounds of uncertainty ."
acj-fragment01,134,A second M_approach is to M_frame the law M_in such a M_way as to M_make it M_clear that the court should M_make a moral judgment M_on the gravity of the defendant 's conduct .
acj-fragment01,135,M_Section 210.2 of the M_Model Penal Code M_includes M_within murder M_those reckless killings which manifest ‰Û÷ M_extreme indifference M_to the M_value of human life ‰Ûª .
acj-fragment01,136,"Scots law M_treats as murder killings M_with ‰Û÷ M_wicked recklessness ‰Ûª , a phrase which M_directs the court 's attention M_to the circumstances of the killing ."
acj-fragment01,137,"Both the M_Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be M_reduced M_to circularity , however , for when one asks how M_extreme or how M_wicked the recklessness should be , the only possible answer is : ‰Û÷ M_wicked or M_extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction ‰Ûª ."
acj-fragment01,138,"Admittedly , the M_Model Penal Code does M_contain a list of circumstances which may M_amount M_to M_extreme indifference , which M_assists the courts and M_increases the predictability of verdicts M_in a M_way that Scots law does not , but the M_essence of both M_approaches is that there is no precise M_way of describing M_those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings ."
acj-fragment01,139,"Their M_protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation M_from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate M_labelling by the courts ; M_opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed M_here specifically to M_reduce the risk of verdicts based M_on discriminatory or irrelevant factors , such as distaste for the defendant 's M_background , allegiance , or other activities ."
acj-fragment01,140,"A third , more precise M_formulation M_derives M_from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee M_in 1980 , namely , that a killing should be classified as murder M_in M_those M_situations M_where there is an intention to cause M_serious injury coupled M_with awareness of the risk of death ."
acj-fragment01,141,"Neither an intention to cause serious injury nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient M_on its own , but together they M_restrict one another , M_producing a test which both M_satisfies the criterion of certainty and M_marks M_out some heinous but non-intended killings ."
acj-fragment01,142,"A fourth M_approach , M_adopted by English M_law M_until 1957 and still M_in M_force M_in many American jurisdictions , is some M_form of felony-murder rule : anyone who kills during the M_course of a felony ( or , more restrictively , a serious crime of violence ) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder ."
acj-fragment01,143,"Thus stated , there is no reference M_to the defendant 's intention or awareness of the risks : the fact that D has chosen to commit rape , robbery , or another M_serious offence , and has caused death thereby , is M_held to constitute sufficient moral M_grounds for M_placing the killing M_in the M_highest category ."
acj-fragment01,144,"Plainly , M_this is a M_form of M_constructive criminal liability : the murder conviction is M_constructed out of the M_ingredients of a lesser offence ."
acj-fragment01,145,"Presumably the justification is that D has already M_crossed a M_high moral/social M_threshold M_in choosing to commit such a M_serious offence , and should therefore be M_held liable for whatever consequences ensue , however unforeseeable they may be ."
acj-fragment01,146,"The objections would be M_reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required : M_in other words , if the test were the commission of a M_serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death ."
acj-fragment01,147,"The effect of M_that test would be to pick out M_those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested M_substantial moral and legal culpability , and to classify them as murder ."
acj-fragment01,148,"Four alternative M_approaches have been described , and many others could be listed ."
acj-fragment01,149,"The M_point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not , of themselves , appear to be sufficiently well M_focused to M_mark M_out M_those killings which are the most heinous ."
acj-fragment01,150,The law must M_resort M_to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to M_identify and M_separate M_out the most heinous killings .
acj-fragment01,151,"Many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is , generally speaking , no excuse for using such dangerous equipment ."
acj-fragment01,152,"Some of the people thus M_covered would be armed robbers , others would be terrorists ."
acj-fragment01,153,"The armed robber might say that he M_had no intention of using the firearm , that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim , and that it went off accidentally : if the jury believes M_that , should he be convicted of murder ?"

ahb-fragment51,707,By FRANCESCA SIMON
ahb-fragment51,708,DEBBIE ADAMS had to let her East End terrace house in London M_in a hurry when her husband was re-located to Ireland M_with two months ' notice .
ahb-fragment51,709,"She went to a local letting agency , Landlords M_of 41 Roman Road , Bethnal Green , London E2 , who M_found a tenant M_that day ."
ahb-fragment51,710,She also M_employed Landlords to manage the let .
ahb-fragment51,711,"As is common practice , Landlords M_kept the tenant 's M_deposit M_of å£650 and M_told Debbie M_they would M_take their entire fee M_of å£881 M_up M_front , so she expected no rent M_for the first month ."
ahb-fragment51,712,But July also M_passed M_without Debbie receiving any money .
ahb-fragment51,713,"‰Û÷ I phoned and said , ‰Û÷ Where 's the money ? ‰Ûª and was told there were problems M_with the book-keeper , who would be M_coming M_in to M_sort it M_out , ‰Ûª says Debbie ."
ahb-fragment51,714,‰Û÷ But nothing happened and I never M_heard M_from them . ‰Ûª
ahb-fragment51,715,"She repeatedly M_phoned Landlords , but was either unable to M_get an M_answer or M_told that manager Howard Keizner was M_unavailable ."
ahb-fragment51,716,"Finally , M_after the third month M_passed M_with no rent received , Debbie phoned the tenants , asked them to pay her M_directly , and M_sent Landlords a recorded-delivery letter , which was returned , and finally one by ordinary post M_stating that Landlords were no longer M_employed as the managing agents ."
ahb-fragment51,717,"Because M_they had n't done any management , Debbie M_felt Landlords were M_entitled only M_to the 10 per cent M_tenant-finding fee and therefore owed her å£2,400 ( 3 months ' rent plus the M_deposit ) ."
ahb-fragment51,718,M_In December 1991 she sued .
ahb-fragment51,719,"Landlords did n't M_acknowledge the writ , so M_in January Debbie 's solicitor requested a judgment M_in default M_for the M_full amount plus interest and court fees , a total M_of å£2,453.24 ."
ahb-fragment51,720,"Just before the court was due to M_hear the request her solicitor received a cheque M_for å£2,400 ."
ahb-fragment51,721,"‰Û÷ M_They had n't paid the interest and court fees , but we got back every single penny M_they owed ."
ahb-fragment51,722,"We were lucky , ‰Ûª says Debbie Adams ."
ahb-fragment51,723,"Howard Keizner , M_of Landlords , said : ‰Û÷ There were a M_lot M_of complications M_with M_this particular letting and management . ‰Ûª"
ahb-fragment51,724,But he declined M_further comment .
ahb-fragment51,725,"Last week he promised to supply us M_with a written explanation M_of the M_way his company had M_treated Debbie , but it never M_arrived ."
ahb-fragment51,726,Yusuf and Shabira Gulamali were less fortunate .
ahb-fragment51,727,"They M_lost M_over å£4,000 M_dealing M_with two letting agencies which closed down M_without M_paying them the rent and tenants ' M_deposit owed M_on their Wembley flat ."
ahb-fragment51,728,"They hired the first agent , ‰Û÷ Digs ‰Ûª , M_of Oxford Street , to manage as well as to let their flat ."
ahb-fragment51,729,"The Gulamalis received their rent M_for the first three months , then nothing M_for four months , and were M_told the computer was M_broken , the accounts were being M_moved , the cheque was M_in the post , and so on ."
ahb-fragment51,730,"‰Û÷ M_After four months M_they closed down owing us å£3,500 , ‰Ûª says Shabira ."
ahb-fragment51,731,‰Û÷ M_Together with some other clients we M_took the owner M_to court but he escaped to Spain . ‰Ûª
ahb-fragment51,732,"The second time M_round they M_dealt M_with R. and B. Lettings in London NW10 , who they instructed just to M_find a tenant ."
ahb-fragment51,733,"The Gulamalis never received the agreement form , the tenants ' M_deposit or the first month 's rent ."
ahb-fragment51,734,"‰Û÷ Finally , we went to the office and M_they M_gave us a cheque , which M_bounced . ‰Ûª"
ahb-fragment51,735,The offices M_of R and B. Lettings are now M_up M_for sale .
ahb-fragment51,736,"‰Û÷ Anyone can M_set M_up a letting agency , ‰Ûª says David Galsworthy , Vice President M_of the National Association M_of Estate Agents ."
ahb-fragment51,737,"‰Û÷ They M_come and M_go , so it M_pays to M_deal M_with a M_member M_of a professional M_body , such as the NAEA , the Royal Institute M_of Chartered Surveyors or the Incorporated Society M_of Valuers and Auctioneers ."
ahb-fragment51,738,"In case of a dispute you can complain M_to the professional M_body , and M_members are M_bonded , which M_means that M_deposits and rent are M_covered in case of fraud or dishonesty . ‰Ûª"
ahb-fragment51,739,"If you are thinking M_of letting your property , the M_following M_points will help to safeguard your interests :"
ahb-fragment51,740,M_Ask any agency you are M_considering using if M_they are a M_member M_of one M_of the above professional associations .
ahb-fragment51,741,"If M_in doubt , M_ask to see proof M_of their membership ."
ahb-fragment51,742,"If , in addition to M_finding a tenant , the agency is M_managing the let , you should be paid every month , less a M_tenant-finding fee M_of M_between two and four weeks ' rent ."
ahb-fragment51,743,The agency will M_keep the tenant 's M_deposit M_until the tenant leaves .
ahb-fragment51,744,"If the letting agent is not managing the flat , the tenant 's M_deposit should be M_given to the owner M_immediately ."
ahb-fragment51,745,Expect to pay a management fee M_of up to 15 per cent .
ahb-fragment51,746,"Some agencies M_deduct it every month , others M_want it all M_up M_front , so shop around ."
ahb-fragment51,747,"If the owner is abroad , the agent will also M_collect tax M_at the standard rate M_of 25 per cent , which will be deducted M_from your monthly rent cheque ."
ahb-fragment51,748,"Letting agencies should never M_charge tenants a finder 's fee , although according to Galsworthy , many agencies M_do ."
ahb-fragment51,749,"‰Û÷ It 's not ethical as they are M_acting M_for the landlord , ‰Ûª he says ."
ahb-fragment51,750,"The self-regulating NAEA M_has 10,000 M_members , of which 2,000 also do letting and management ."
ahb-fragment51,751,But Galsworthy believes there is a M_clear need M_for the licensing M_of all letting agents .
ahb-fragment51,752,"‰Û÷ We want everyone to be licensed , but the Government did n't M_think it necessary ."
ahb-fragment51,753,"M_Section 22 of the 1979 Estate Agents Act M_dealing M_with M_bonding , licensing and M_standards M_of competency has not been M_brought M_in ."

ahc-fragment60,1210,Travel : Copse and robbers Christopher Somerville M_sees how woodland has M_usurped the ancient cattle thieves M_of the Cheviot Hills
ahc-fragment60,1211,By CHRISTOPHER SOMERVILLE
ahc-fragment60,1212,"WHEN a Charlton chief sat down to dinner M_in times M_gone M_by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been , he knew the cupboard was M_bare once more ."
ahc-fragment60,1213,His wife was M_telling him to saddle up and steal a M_fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour 's herds .
ahc-fragment60,1214,"The families M_of North Tynedale in westernmost Northumberland ‰ÛÓ Charltons and Robsons , Milburns and Dodds ‰ÛÓ were never M_slow to M_lay M_hands M_on each other 's property M_in the M_lawless M_old days ."
ahc-fragment60,1215,"Here , where the Scottish M_border M_ran across the Cheviot Hills , far from civilisation , ‰Û÷ reiving ‰Ûª , or cattle-thieving , was a M_way M_of life ."
ahc-fragment60,1216,"Remoteness is still the keynote M_of M_this region , but a Charlton reiving party would be M_hard M_put M_to it M_these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the North Tyne River ."
ahc-fragment60,1217,"Since 1926 the western fringes of the Cheviots have been planted M_with 250 square miles of M_close-packed conifers , while in their depths M_sprawl the seven miles of the Kielder Water reservoir , Europe 's largest man-made lake ."
ahc-fragment60,1218,"I M_found it M_hard to M_picture what kind M_of landscape M_those statistics might have M_shaped , until I opened the Ordnance Survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre ."
ahc-fragment60,1219,"Kielder Water is beautiful , and the Kielder trees formidably impressive M_in their domination M_of the hills ."
ahc-fragment60,1220,"But M_by the time I had turned off the road from Bellingham at Kielder village and driven M_up the bumpy Forest Drive to East Kielder Farm , I was longing M_for the sight M_of something other than water and trees ."
ahc-fragment60,1221,M_Relief was M_at M_hand .
ahc-fragment60,1222,"The farm M_stands on a M_spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest , and M_within 10 minutes I had turned my back M_on the M_corduroy M_battalions of trees and was striding under a still , cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass , M_with my face to the long , M_bare M_shoulders M_of M_open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the East Kielder Burn ."
ahc-fragment60,1223,The footpath that M_runs with the burn is not one of M_those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the Forestry Commission .
ahc-fragment60,1224,There are few M_attractions M_for the Kielder tourist here .
ahc-fragment60,1225,"The burn M_threads a wild and M_inhospitable crevice of the hills , where the wind M_blows cold and the M_sense M_of M_isolation M_grows M_with each M_lonely mile ."
ahc-fragment60,1226,"Walking here , you M_leave the 20th century M_behind M_on the M_outskirts of the forest and M_enter the M_reconstructed emptiness M_in which the reivers and cross-border raiders M_of the past could M_operate unhindered ."
ahc-fragment60,1227,"I squelched across tiny burns M_running M_in black channels of peat , and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of Scaup Farm ."
ahc-fragment60,1228,"The M_hollow barking M_of a dog M_came from one of the stone sheds , but there was no M_sign M_of life around the buildings ."
ahc-fragment60,1229,"Scaup must be just about the M_loneliest farm in England , M_tucked down M_in the shelter M_of the hills M_with Kielder Forest 's M_dark mass M_blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn M_filling half the sky to the north ."
ahc-fragment60,1230,The East Kielder Burn divides here M_into Scaup Burn and White Kielder Burn .
ahc-fragment60,1231,"I dropped down the hill to ford White Kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of Kielder Head , where a M_line of stunted alders , M_shaggy with lichen , M_leaned over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown water ."
ahc-fragment60,1232,Spring M_comes late M_to M_this windM_bitten and rain-soaked valley .
ahc-fragment60,1233,"But there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of Scaup , and a cheery ‰Û÷ Hello now ‰Ûª from the farmer and his wife tending them ."
ahc-fragment60,1234,M_Those were the last human voices I heard all day .
ahc-fragment60,1235,No-one lives up here in the cleft of the White Kielder Burn .
ahc-fragment60,1236,"The rough land is altogether too M_harsh and unyielding , M_giving sustenance only to sheep , and to the conifers high on the M_flanks of East Kielder Moor and Grey Mares Knowe , immense M_sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valley ."
ahc-fragment60,1237,"The footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track , but there were M_clues M_to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to Byrness in Redesdale ."
ahc-fragment60,1238,"Large boulders stood out beside the path as grey M_blobs in the featureless M_sheets of M_pale grass , and flat stones had been placed as M_bridges across the burns , their M_backs hollowed by the tread M_of feet M_through the centuries ."
ahc-fragment60,1239,"M_Following M_these now disregarded M_signs M_of past activity along the old path , I traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold M_with the roofless remains of a shepherd 's hut built into one wall ."
ahc-fragment60,1240,"The tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens , but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the M_foot of the hut 's M_tottering gable end , and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway ."
ahc-fragment60,1241,"A dipper flew up from the burn as I emerged from the hut , his white M_breast M_flashing as he darted downstream ."
ahc-fragment60,1242,"Somewhere ahead in the crags of Kielderhead Moor a hawk was M_whistling , a piercing sound in the M_lonely valley , M_overlain M_for a few heart-stopping moments by the M_snarl M_of a jet ."
ahc-fragment60,1243,"M_That M_jarring manifestation M_of M_furious technology seemed as M_remote and ridiculous as a M_dream , as silence M_settled M_down on Kielderhead and the hawk 's whistle came down from the moors ."
ahc-fragment60,1244,"The valley of the White Kielder Burn steepened again as I trudged north , its curves M_tightening ."
ahc-fragment60,1245,"Now the path M_ran through heather high above the burn , past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony M_beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting , concealing M_ankle-breaking drops ."
ahc-fragment60,1246,"A mile above the shepherd 's hut the hillsides M_ceased their upward M_rolling and curved together to M_form a dead-end valley of M_broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road , hidden deep in the M_folds of the moors ."
ahc-fragment60,1247,The old drover 's road M_turned aside here and M_climbed under the rock M_faces of White Crags to continue its M_lonely course over Girdle Fell and down into Redesdale .
ahc-fragment60,1248,"I could have gone M_with it , M_giving myself four blissful miles M_of upland walking M_followed by as many miserable hours M_of fruitless searching M_for return transport to East Kielder Farm ."
ahc-fragment60,1249,Instead I lay back in the heather and M_savoured the trickle of the burn and the M_crisp smell of peat-laden ground .
ahc-fragment60,1250,"Not a M_sign M_of spring had yet M_penetrated M_this secret valley , but another month would M_put M_that right ."

ahf-fragment24,547,"‰Û÷ He 's only come because the press are here , ‰Ûª says the first fat lady ."
ahf-fragment24,548,And Paddy Cosgrove blushes .
ahf-fragment24,549,Political M_consciousness is M_low on the Meadowell Estate .
ahf-fragment24,550,"Turnout M_at the last election was M_around 50 per cent , and M_with the M_thinning of the electoral M_roll M_brought by the poll tax , will be even M_lower M_this time ."
ahf-fragment24,551,They are mostly Labour voters but several confuse their Labour candidate M_with the leader of the Liberal Democrats .
ahf-fragment24,552,"Very few know their MP is a Conservative , and hardly anyone that his name is Neville Trotter , M_defender of a M_slender 2,500 majority ."
ahf-fragment24,553,"By most M_measures Meadowell is the worst council estate in Britain , and probably the most notorious since the riots last September , which M_followed the deaths of joyriders Colin Atkins and Dale Robson M_in a police chase ."
ahf-fragment24,554,"M_In fact Meadowell is an M_Elastoplast name like Sizewell , invented M_in the 1970s to M_disguise what was already a M_running M_sore ."
ahf-fragment24,555,"When built M_in 1938 it was The Ridges , which is still what they call it locally ‰ÛÓ a slum clearance project on the north bank of the Tyne , 10 miles east of Newcastle ."
ahf-fragment24,556,"Its first inhabitants were shipyard and fishquay workers from the riverside towns of North Shields and Wallsend , who moved happily from their tumbledown terraces to M_these M_fine new houses with inside toilets and gardens ."
ahf-fragment24,557,"Many , like Ronnie Collyer , a retired shipyard worker , still live here and are still proud of the place ."

ahf-fragment24,562,But something was wrong M_from the M_start .

ahf-fragment63,1157,By FRANK JOHNSON
ahf-fragment63,1158,WE WERE in the West Country .
ahf-fragment63,1159,The Prime Minister was M_on his M_soapbox .
ahf-fragment63,1160,"Just M_up the road , at Langport in Somerset , was the birthplace of Walter Bagehot ( 1826‰ÛÒ1877 ) , although as he M_directed his microphone at Liberal Democrat hecklers John Major M_had other M_things M_on his mind ."
ahf-fragment63,1161,The relevance is that Bagehot was the first political commentator .
ahf-fragment63,1162,"The travelling M_chaos of a modern party leader 's election entourage had M_carried Major within a few miles of the home of the founder of the profession , a few of whose more troublesome contemporary practitioners are said to have caused him much M_irritation M_over the 16 months of his premiership ."
ahf-fragment63,1163,‰Û÷ A Liberal ?
ahf-fragment63,1164,He 's M_admitted M_to being a Liberal ! ‰Ûª
ahf-fragment63,1165,"Major cried , jabbing a finger M_in the direction of one heckler ."
ahf-fragment63,1166,The man M_had a Liberal Democrat rosette pinned to his cap .
ahf-fragment63,1167,"He was also carrying an orange poster on a pole , M_urging a vote for the local Liberal Democrat candidate ."
ahf-fragment63,1168,Therefore the admission which the Prime Minister M_wrung M_from him could hardly be said to have been grudging .
ahf-fragment63,1169,"But , like all the best soapbox orators , Major had M_prepared his repartee M_in M_advance ."
ahf-fragment63,1170,"‰Û÷ I knew there was one here , ‰Ûª he continued , meaning Liberal Democrats ."
ahf-fragment63,1171,"There were , M_in fact , M_about a M_score ."
ahf-fragment63,1172,"Then M_came the M_passage , which appeared M_on the television news M_that evening and M_in the papers the M_next day , M_about the Liberal Democrats being the M_Trojan M_horse that would M_let Labour M_in ."
ahf-fragment63,1173,There were also some M_lines intended for local M_consumption : ‰Û÷ M_Higher petrol prices M_from the Liberal Democrats ‰Û_ M_that 's not gon na M_help a rural area ‰Û_
ahf-fragment63,1174,‰Ûª What would Bagehot have M_made of him ?
ahf-fragment63,1175,"Like the heckler , he was a Liberal ."
ahf-fragment63,1176,"M_There the similarity ends , since M_judging M_from his writings Bagehot was a M_roaring snob , whereas M_judging M_from his heckles the heckler was not ."
ahf-fragment63,1177,"More M_to the M_point , it was Bagehot who said : ‰Û÷ A M_constitutional statesman is in general a man of common opinions and uncommon abilities . ‰Ûª"
ahf-fragment63,1178,The statesman M_to whom he was M_referring was Peel .
ahf-fragment63,1179,"A political commentator of our own day , Paul Johnson , quoted it not long after Major became Prime Minister to M_suggest that it was also true of him ."
ahf-fragment63,1180,But is it still ?
ahf-fragment63,1181,"B AGEHOT 'S phrase M_comes M_in a M_passage M_in which he appears to propound the dispiriting theory that a politician , if he wants to M_get M_anywhere , must M_appeal M_to ‰Û÷ the M_average man ‰Ûª ."
ahf-fragment63,1182,"The M_average man is ‰Û÷ a M_cool , common person , M_with a M_considerate air , M_with figures M_in his mind , M_with his own business to M_attend M_to , M_with a set of ordinary opinions M_arising M_from and M_suited M_to ordinary life ."
ahf-fragment63,1183,He ca n't M_bear novelty or originalities ‰Û_
ahf-fragment63,1184,Original theories M_give trouble ‰Ûª .
ahf-fragment63,1185,"Bagehot M_goes M_on to say of Peel : ‰Û÷ M_From a certain peculiarity of intellect and fortune , he was never M_in M_advance of his time ."
ahf-fragment63,1186,"Of almost all the M_great M_measures M_with which his name is associated , he attained M_great eminence as an opponent before he attained even M_greater eminence as their M_advocate . ‰Ûª"
ahf-fragment63,1187,M_That last sentence M_has more to M_do M_with Kinnock than M_with Major .
ahf-fragment63,1188,"It is also a warning M_to all M_hack Tories who think that it is a telling M_blow M_against Kinnock to keep on M_pointing M_out that he has M_reversed his opinions M_about unilateral nuclear disarmament , British membership of the EC , or anything else ."
ahf-fragment63,1189,"But the most striking M_thing M_about Bagehot 's essay M_on Peel , in the light of the last M_full week of M_this election M_campaign , is that it simply does not M_apply M_to Major at all ."
ahf-fragment63,1190,Common opinions were what M_got Major M_into difficulties M_in the first M_place .
ahf-fragment63,1191,"M_Between his becoming Prime Minister and his party 's M_fall M_in the polls M_about 10 days ago , Major did nearly everthing that common opinion M_wanted him to do ."
ahf-fragment63,1192,M_This was M_true of what he did M_about both M_high policy and M_low politics .
ahf-fragment63,1193,"For example , M_on M_high policy common opinion M_said that there was nothing for it but to M_stay M_in the ERM ."
ahf-fragment63,1194,"He M_stayed M_in , and the recession worsened ."
ahf-fragment63,1195,"M_In M_low politics , common opinion ‰ÛÓ no less common for being expensively M_hired by Conservative Central Office ‰ÛÓ M_encouraged him M_in the belief that he should M_fight much of the election sitting down ."
ahf-fragment63,1196,"He did so , and he looked like the questioner in the studio audience rather than the answerer ."
ahf-fragment63,1197,"The result was Wobbly Week , the second week of the M_campaign ."
ahf-fragment63,1198,But last Saturday Major M_climbed M_on M_to M_that M_soapbox in Luton .
ahf-fragment63,1199,"M_Until then , he had been M_that most inhuman of creatures ‰ÛÓ the public figure described by others as ‰Û÷ very human ‰Ûª ."
ahf-fragment63,1200,"Now he really was human ‰ÛÓ unscripted , jokey , even a bit passionate ."
ahf-fragment63,1201,The M_jubilant word M_from Kinnock 's M_camp was that Major was behaving more like an opposition leader than a prime minister .
ahf-fragment63,1202,But there seemed nothing wrong M_with the M_head of government appearing to be the M_challenger M_on the hustings .
ahf-fragment63,1203,"President Truman did so M_in a M_campaign which no-one expected him to win , and he won ."
ahf-fragment63,1204,It is M_justified if the M_head of government is M_challenging something M_powerful .
ahf-fragment63,1205,"Kinnock complains of the alleged power of the Tory tabloid press , but he M_has M_powers M_on his M_side too ."
ahf-fragment63,1206,"Ninety per cent of his party 's cash M_comes M_from the unions , which will M_expect a M_return ."
ahf-fragment63,1207,The British people have M_in the past M_found them rather more M_powerful than the corporations which are popularly supposed to finance the Conservative party .
ahf-fragment63,1208,"Then there are all M_those schoolteachers , dons , television producers , writers M_on arts pages and M_members of the agitating classes who M_want a Labour win in order to impose Political Correctness ."
ahf-fragment63,1209,"That is to say , they will M_have what the Jesuits once M_attached such importance M_to : M_power M_over young or impressionable minds ."
ahf-fragment63,1210,"As the week M_went M_by , Major rejected common opinion M_about two other M_large M_subjects : proportional representation and Scottish devolution ."
ahf-fragment63,1211,"He M_hardened his opposition M_to both , despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first , and vocal M_forces M_within his Scottish party were in support of the second ."
ahf-fragment63,1212,"E VEN M_at M_this late hour , psephology , demographics and luck M_suggest that the Tories could still M_emerge as the M_biggest single party M_in a M_hung Parliament ."
ahf-fragment63,1213,Is it possible that Major would rather M_go M_into opposition ‰ÛÓ M_with the M_dangers M_that would M_mean for his continued leadership of the Conservative party ‰ÛÓ than offer PR and Scottish devolution M_to the Liberal Democrats ?
ahf-fragment63,1214,"If so , we are M_dealing M_with a more Quixotic , romantic or principled figure than some of us used to think ."
ahf-fragment63,1215,"Once M_that M_soapbox M_came M_out , Major campaigned as if he would now do and say what he really thought ."
ahf-fragment63,1216,Was it too late ?
ahf-fragment63,1217,"M_From Central Office , and M_from around his entourage , M_came the unmistakable M_signs of M_fair-weather friends M_preparing to M_detach themselves M_from blame for defeat ."
ahf-fragment63,1218,"And then , M_on Thursday morning , when Major 's election tour M_reached the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition , Sir David English , the paper 's editor , was not there to greet him ."
ahf-fragment63,1219,"A M_junior spin doctor is reported to have muttered , though admittedly out of my earshot : ‰Û÷ We 've been snubbed . ‰Ûª"
ahf-fragment63,1220,Not Sir David !
ahf-fragment63,1221,"Some M_in the profession of political commentating would opt for Bagehot as their formative influence , but mine has long been Sir David ‰ÛÓ a founder of biased Tory journalism ."
ahf-fragment63,1222,His lack of humbug M_about political M_balance has always M_made him more honest than all the employees of BBC Current Affairs awaiting M_with glee the Kinnock years .
ahf-fragment63,1223,"Eventually , Sir David 's office M_issued a statement M_about the Prime Minister ."
ahf-fragment63,1224,"Normally , a prime minister 's office would M_issue a statement M_about an editor ."
ahf-fragment63,1225,"But Major M_makes a M_point of not being grand , and M_with Sir David it is the other M_way M_about ."
ahf-fragment63,1226,"‰Û÷ Sir David English was not informed of the visit and M_in consequence M_had no M_plans to attend the Ideal Home Exhibition M_that day , ‰Ûª the official statement M_announced ."
ahf-fragment63,1227,Faith M_in Sir David 's leadership was M_restored .

ahl-fragment02,5,by Greg Neale Environment Correspondent
ahl-fragment02,6,HUNDREDS of thousands of dolphins could be saved M_from death M_thanks M_to pioneering work by British scientists .
ahl-fragment02,7,"They believe they have M_found a cheap , practical M_means of preventing dolphins entangling themselves in monofilament drift fishing nets ‰ÛÓ the ‰Û÷ M_walls of death ‰Ûª believed to be M_responsible for killing large numbers of dolphins off Cornwall M_this year ."
ahl-fragment02,8,But their work is M_hampered by lack of money .
ahl-fragment02,9,"So M_far they have M_received nothing M_from the Government , little EC M_assistance and are M_running M_out of funds M_donated by individuals and industry ."
ahl-fragment02,10,"The researchers , M_headed by Dr Margaret Klinowska , a Cambridge biologist , and David Goodson , an expert M_on acoustic engineering M_at Loughborough University , M_say M_new data M_shows that plastic sound M_reflectors to fishing nets can M_warn dolphins of hazards ."
ahl-fragment02,11,"Data to be published shortly draws on experiments including observations of Freddy , the dolphin that has been living off the Northumbrian coast for four years ."
ahl-fragment02,12,"Using equipment M_donated by Racal , the scientists have analysed recordings of the ‰Û÷ clicking ‰Ûª dolphins make while hunting ."
ahl-fragment02,13,Observations of Freddy M_led them to conclude that dolphins M_use sonar while hunting .
ahl-fragment02,14,"They emit an intense , broad-band ‰Û÷ click ‰Ûª or M_pulse of sound ."
ahl-fragment02,15,"Echoes of the signal M_alert them to possible prey , at ranges up to 80‰ÛÒ90 metres in shallow waters ."
ahl-fragment02,16,"Mr Goodson , who became interested M_in the sonar M_capacity of dolphins M_after hearing one while swimming off the Welsh coast , has M_experimented with various shapes of sound M_reflectors ."
ahl-fragment02,17,"The most promising is eliptical , M_about 3å_in long ."
ahl-fragment02,18,"The theory is that its internal air pocket will ‰Û÷ M_bounce ‰Ûª M_back the dolphin 's sonar signal , regardless of the direction of approach ."
ahl-fragment02,19,"Last autumn , Dr Klinowska , Mr Goodson and their M_team M_put the theories M_into practice ."
ahl-fragment02,20,"In the Moray Firth , they placed a ‰Û÷ M_headline M_barrier ‰Ûª , from which they had suspended M_reflectors at two-metre intervals ."
ahl-fragment02,21,"The movement of dolphins around the M_barrier was observed , using electronic equipment to monitor sonar M_activity ."
ahl-fragment02,22,"‰Û÷ The results exceeded our expectations , ‰Ûª said Mr Goodson ."
ahl-fragment02,23,"Dolphins swimming near the M_barrier altered their behaviour to avoid M_it , the result , the scientists believe , of them M_detecting sonar echoes from the M_reflectors ."
ahl-fragment02,24,"Dr Klinowska said that , although it was necessary to be cautious M_about the findings , a combination of M_reflector devices and some modification of fishing gear might M_reduce deaths ."
ahl-fragment02,25,But the Moray Firth experiments were only possible after the naturalist Dr David Bellamy helped M_secure a M_donation M_from the Co-operative Wholesale Society .
ahl-fragment02,26,"‰Û÷ Our work is being delayed simply M_through the lack of funding , ‰Ûª said Dr Klinowska ."
ahl-fragment02,27,"The scientists hope to M_raise å£100,000 M_through an M_appeal by Windsor Safari Park ."

al0-fragment06,182,"An earlier film by Raphael , The Persuaders ( 1986 ) , M_charted the transformation of Ricki M_into Rytasha , which M_occurred at the Hare Krishna Temple in London , and her M_uneasy relationship M_with her guru there ."
al0-fragment06,183,It would have been interesting to have seen the two films M_together .
al0-fragment06,184,"Since 1986 Rytasha has M_broken M_awayM_from her guru and M_set M_up M_on her own M_with a charity called Food Relief International , which M_raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of Palm Beach and M_distributes it to the starving people of Bangladesh ."
al0-fragment06,185,"‰Û÷ She adaws Bangladesh , ‰Ûª M_gushed Rytasha 's mother ‰ÛÓ the fiercest matron of them all , rejoicing M_in the improbable title of Baroness Thea von Theilheimer Shenkman ."
al0-fragment06,186,She M_went M_on to list her daughter 's achievements : ‰Û÷ She put in an M_irritation system ‰Û_
al0-fragment06,187,"‰Ûª M_With no M_trace of a smile or a blush the baroness M_quickly corrected herself ‰ÛÓ ‰Û÷ an irrigation system ‰Ûª ‰ÛÓ but the M_slip was a telling M_one , and I 'm sure they would have appreciated M_it in Bangladesh ."
al0-fragment06,188,"The villagers of Ramsala , recipients of the Palm Beach dollars , M_explained M_to the cameras that they desperately needed a clinic ."
al0-fragment06,189,"‰Û÷ We told her that a mud hut would M_do , but she said no , she 'd build something pukka . ‰Ûª"

al0-fragment06,194,"The money ran out M_before the scheme 's completion , and the villagers M_found themselves obliged to borrow the rest ."
al0-fragment06,195,"They begged Rytasha for reimbursement , but none was forthcoming , and for the want of a few hundred pounds the village M_lost its crop for the year ."
al0-fragment06,196,‰Û÷ Now what are we supposed to do ? ‰Ûª asked one of them .
al0-fragment06,197,‰Û÷ Are we to sell our cattle or our land ? ‰Ûª
al0-fragment06,198,"The most irritating M_thing M_about Rytasha ‰ÛÓ and there were M_many ‰ÛÓ was that , though she does not speak their language , she presumes to teach them a spurious M_form of their own religion ."

al2-fragment23,252,City : Lloyd 's M_members fail M_in bid to protect cash fund
al2-fragment23,253,By Karen Cooper
al2-fragment23,254,MORE than 800 Lloyd 's of London M_members M_on syndicates M_managed by the loss-making Gooda Walker agency have failed M_in their legal attempt to prevent Lloyd 's and M_members ' agents M_from M_drawing M_down their funds .
al2-fragment23,255,"Michael Freeman , the solicitor who advised the M_members M_on court action , said yesterday : ‰Û÷ M_This will cause the most dreadful hardship ."
al2-fragment23,256,There is going to be a M_great M_deal of M_pain M_in the M_market M_place now . ‰Ûª
al2-fragment23,257,"M_In an earlier than expected Commercial Court judgment , Mr Justice Saville M_found that the M_members had not M_produced enough evidence of M_irregularities M_in the ‰Û÷ LMX M_spiral ‰Ûª , which M_sends catastrophe risks M_swirling M_round the M_market to M_stop the usual process of M_calling M_on cash M_deposits to M_make good syndicate losses ."
al2-fragment23,258,"However , he suggested there was perhaps a need to M_look M_into the M_system more closely ."
al2-fragment23,259,Costs were awarded M_to the M_members ' agents but not to Lloyd 's .
al2-fragment23,260,"The M_members , many of whom are unable to fulfil the latest å£101m cash M_call due M_on March 2 to M_cover 1989‰ÛÒ90 losses M_on syndicates were M_seeking an interim injunction to M_stop M_members ' agents and Lloyd 's M_dipping M_into their security ."
al2-fragment23,261,"They were M_challenging the ‰Û÷ pay now sue later ‰Ûª principle M_at Lloyd 's , which M_says names should M_pay cash M_calls first and M_fight them later ."
al2-fragment23,262,Lloyd 's chairman David Coleridge M_welcomed the judgment .
al2-fragment23,263,"‰Û÷ We M_have every sympathy M_with M_those who have M_made M_substantial underwriting losses M_in recent years but Lloyd 's M_owes its first M_duty to policyholders M_with valid claims which must be M_met , ‰Ûª he said ."
al2-fragment23,264,"Mr Freeman said an appeal was ‰Û÷ most unlikely , because we are not going to M_get any more evidence . ‰Ûª"
al2-fragment23,265,"Earlier M_this month , preliminary findings M_from an investigation by Kenneth Randall M_found that the Gooda Walker agency may have M_overstated its syndicates ' profits M_between 1981 and 1988 M_through the M_use of time and M_distance policies , M_about which it had M_failed to inform its auditors M_in at least one syndicate ."
al2-fragment23,266,"Peter Nutting , who M_led the association of Outhwaite M_members M_to a M_succesful M_settlement , said he sympathised M_with Gooda Walker names , but ‰Û÷ if the names were not going to M_pay M_these M_calls , who did they think was going to pay M_them ? ‰Ûª"

al5-fragment03,16,By GEORGE JONES
al5-fragment03,17,"THE NEW Health Secretary , Mrs Virginia Bottomley , M_set herself an M_ambitious M_target yesterday ‰ÛÓ to ‰Û÷ M_take the politics ‰Ûª M_out M_of the National Health Service ."
al5-fragment03,18,"But her desire to provide a period of M_stability for nearly one million people M_employed by the NHS is M_coupled M_with a fierce determination to M_maintain the M_momentum of reform , M_with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts M_by the mid-1990s ."
al5-fragment03,19,"Labour M_sought to M_turn the general election M_into a referendum M_on the NHS , M_asking voters for a mandate to M_reverse the changes ."
al5-fragment03,20,"Mrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms ‰ÛÓ and to M_give doctors , nurses and managers the confidence to M_make them M_work ."
al5-fragment03,21,"M_In her first M_full interview since being appointed Health Secretary , she said the election result , and Mr Major 's unequivocal commitment M_to the NHS , had finally ‰Û÷ M_nailed the lie ‰Ûª M_about privatisation of health care ."
al5-fragment03,22,‰Û÷ The NHS is not for profit .
al5-fragment03,23,It is not for sale .
al5-fragment03,24,"It will continue to be M_true M_to its M_founding principles , available M_to all and M_free M_at the M_point of M_delivery , ‰Ûª she said ."
al5-fragment03,25,She M_recalled a promise M_made by Mr Major when he became Prime Minister : that he would work for a nation M_at M_ease M_with itself .
al5-fragment03,26,‰Û÷ I want to M_see a health service M_at M_ease M_with itself ‰ÛÓ M_optimistic and M_confident M_about its essential M_work .
al5-fragment03,27,"Health is something which M_touches every individual and family in the country , ‰Ûª she said ."
al5-fragment03,28,‰Û÷ But there must be changes .
al5-fragment03,29,An organisation that does n't change M_fossilises .
al5-fragment03,30,Health needs to develop and alter . ‰Ûª
al5-fragment03,31,"M_By M_next year , she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts M_within the NHS ."
al5-fragment03,32,"She M_pledged that the Government would safeguard M_those that did not M_opt for trust M_status , but she expected M_this to be a minority ."
al5-fragment03,33,"The Government will also M_encourage more family doctors to M_hold budgets to ‰Û÷ buy ‰Ûª services for patients , and is M_looking M_at M_ways to M_enable smaller practices to M_team M_up to M_secure the advantages of fund M_holding ."
al5-fragment03,34,The election result has M_given the Conservatives five years M_in which to M_press M_ahead M_with the changes .
al5-fragment03,35,Most people are likely to judge the reforms M_on how long they have to wait for treatment ‰ÛÓ the issue M_behind the ‰Û÷ Jennifer 's ear ‰Ûª controversy during the election M_campaign .
al5-fragment03,36,"Mrs Bottomley M_stressed her commitment M_to the Patient 's Charter , which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for NHS operations ."
al5-fragment03,37,"The M_next M_step is to ensure that , M_from March , no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement or a M_cataract operation ."
al5-fragment03,38,A national M_standard will also be M_set for outpatient waiting times .
al5-fragment03,39,"Mrs Bottomley 's first M_big test as Health Secretary will M_come M_this summer M_with the annual public spending M_round , which will be M_conducted M_against a M_background of concern M_over M_high Government borrowing and M_pressure M_from the Tory Right for public spending M_cuts ."
al5-fragment03,40,"The Conservative manifesto M_contained a commitment to increase , year M_by year , the M_level of ‰Û÷ real M_resources ‰Ûª M_committed M_to the NHS ‰ÛÓ though it M_put no figure M_on the extra money to be allocated ."
al5-fragment03,41,"Mrs Bottomley , representing ‰Û÷ M_caring Conservatism ‰Ûª , will face Mr Michael Portillo , the new Treasury Chief Secretary , who is equally M_keen to establish his M_Right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can M_keep keep a M_tight M_grip M_on the public purse strings ."
al5-fragment03,42,She acknowledged that there could be difficult times M_ahead .
al5-fragment03,43,"‰Û÷ It will always be the case that the M_holder of my office will need to M_fight the M_corner of the health service and there will always , inevitably , be more than we can do . ‰Ûª"
al5-fragment03,44,But she M_stressed there would be no let-up M_in the search for M_greater efficiency .
al5-fragment03,45,"As well as M_fighting for more money , her task was to ensure that ‰Û÷ every last pound ‰Ûª was spent as effectively as it could be ."
al5-fragment03,46,"Her priorities include M_giving more encouragement M_to medical research ; M_emphasis M_on preventive health to M_make the NHS a ‰Û÷ health as well as a sickness service ‰Ûª , M_with the publication shortly of M_new national M_targets for M_reducing deaths M_from heart disease and cancers ; and M_pressing M_ahead M_with care M_in the M_community ."
al5-fragment03,47,"As a former psychiatric social worker , Mrs Bottomley is determined to improve M_standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people ."
al5-fragment03,48,‰Û÷ It is not acceptable to M_have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic M_settings .
al5-fragment03,49,"M_That is a real M_challenge , ‰Ûª she said ."
al5-fragment03,50,"Mrs Bottomley 's M_rise M_to the M_top has been M_swift , M_with only four years M_between her first ministerial post and a seat M_at the Cabinet table ."
al5-fragment03,51,But she bridles M_at suggestions that the inclusion of two women ‰ÛÓ Mrs Gillian Shephard M_at the Department of Employment and herself ‰ÛÓ has excluded more able men M_from the Cabinet .
al5-fragment03,52,"‰Û÷ Prime Ministers always have to M_consider M_balance M_in the Cabinet ‰ÛÓ and at least we now M_have the same number of women as M_old Etonians M_in John Major 's M_team , ‰Ûª she said ."
alp-fragment01,1,a Non-punitive Paradigm of Probation Practice : Some Sobering Thoughts L.R. SINGER
alp-fragment01,2,Lawrence Singer is an Assistant Chief Probation Officer M_with Merseyside Probation Service .
alp-fragment01,3,Beforehand he worked as a probation officer for Berkshire Probation Service and later as a research officer for Somerset Probation Service where he undertook the research reported here .
alp-fragment01,4,"The paradigm which is described M_originates M_from doctoral research M_into generic probation practice and has been M_presented M_in a book Adult Probation and Juvenile Supervision : M_Beyond the Care-Control Dilemma ( 1989 , Gower ) ."
alp-fragment01,5,SUMMARY
alp-fragment01,6,"The Government White Paper Crime , Justice and Protecting the Public M_proposes a radical change for probation practice ."
alp-fragment01,7,Henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative M_to punishment but an alternative M_form of punishment .
alp-fragment01,8,M_This article M_challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of M_applying the notion of punishment M_to the probation M_context .
alp-fragment01,9,"Probation officers , it is argued , are concerned M_with establishing M_rules for probationers and not inflicting M_pain M_on them ."
alp-fragment01,10,An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described .
alp-fragment01,11,"The paradigm is M_based M_on the joint supervisory M_aims of M_support and surveillance which are implemented M_through the methods of counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring ."
alp-fragment01,12,"To M_illustrate the paradigm , reference is M_made M_to an alcohol education M_course developed for offenders M_in trouble M_through drink ."
alp-fragment01,13,The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported M_from a three year evaluation study M_covering 152 offenders .
alp-fragment01,14,"The article M_concludes M_with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive M_character of current probation work and M_argues that , to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders M_into the community , the probation officer 's employment of established social work knowledge , skills , and values is a M_strength not a M_weakness ."
alp-fragment01,15,"The M_aim of M_this article is to M_challenge the assertion M_contained M_in the White Paper Crime , Justice and Protecting the Public ( Home Office , 1990a ) that probation practice can be M_conceived of as a M_form of punishment M_in the community ."
alp-fragment01,16,Issue will be M_taken M_with the appropriateness of M_applying the concept of punishment to the probation M_context M_through reference M_to a M_demanding and M_successful probation project M_concerned with offenders M_in trouble M_through drink .
alp-fragment01,17,"M_In describing the project , a non-punitive M_model for understanding probation practice will be developed ."
alp-fragment01,18,"M_This non-punitive paradigm will M_provide a M_framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice M_with future M_plans inappropriately to M_transform probation work M_into ‰Û÷ a new M_approach M_to punishment M_in the community ‰Ûª ( p. 18 , para. 4.3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,19,The punitive M_approach anticipated for the Probation Service M_in the White Paper is M_underpinned by a definition of punishment that M_resides ‰Û÷ M_in the restrictions M_on liberty and M_in the enforcement of the M_orders ‰Ûª .
alp-fragment01,20,"The White Paper M_goes M_on to M_emphasize : ‰Û÷ It is the M_loss of liberty involved M_in carrying out the M_terms of the M_order rather than the activities carried out during the M_order which is the punishment ‰Ûª ( p. 18 , para. 4.4 ) ."
alp-fragment01,21,"Notwithstanding the popular appeal and political M_capital to be derived M_from such a M_humane-sounding statement , M_this definition is nevertheless M_at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment ."
alp-fragment01,22,"Discourses M_on punishment and dictionary definitions of the M_term M_clearly specify the M_central M_feature of punishment as being the infliction of M_pain rather than the M_loss of liberty per se ( Hudson , 1987 ) ."
alp-fragment01,23,The conceptual and practical implications of M_this discrepancy will be examined M_in the third and final M_section of M_this article .
alp-fragment01,24,"Beforehand , however , consideration will be M_given first M_to the probation project and second M_to its evaluation ."
alp-fragment01,25,M_In M_these M_sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of M_pain and the review of the project will M_seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more M_demanding but also more effective than M_this traditional understanding of punishment .
alp-fragment01,26,"M_At a time when the M_Home Secretary is M_inviting the Probation Service to ‰Û÷ M_move M_centre M_stage M_in the Criminal Justice M_System ‰Ûª ( NACRO , 1990 , p. 17 ) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to M_take issue M_with the White Paper 's notion of punishment ."
alp-fragment01,27,Punishment is just a word M_after all : nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only M_lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised M_at the ‰Û÷ M_window of opportunity ‰Ûª .
alp-fragment01,28,"However , M_this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice ; namely that language not only M_reflects but also M_shapes social reality ."
alp-fragment01,29,"As Davies ( 1981 ) has M_pointed M_out , speech is the basic M_tool of the social worker ."
alp-fragment01,30,"What we say influences what we think and M_in M_turn , what we do ."
alp-fragment01,31,If punishment is M_assimilated M_into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service M_undertakes .
alp-fragment01,32,"M_In the M_sections to M_follow the M_stark question is therefore M_put ‰Û÷ Is the Probation Service M_in the business of inflicting M_pain ? ‰Ûª and the answer which M_unfolds may be summarized ‰Û÷ No , because it neither M_aspires nor M_wishes to ! ‰Ûª"
alp-fragment01,33,THE PROJECT : MORE M_DEMANDING THAN PUNISHMENT
alp-fragment01,34,Government concern M_about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the Probation Service .
alp-fragment01,35,"Indeed , as Bochel ( 1976 ) has M_shown , the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably M_linked M_with work undertaken with offenders M_in trouble M_through drink ."
alp-fragment01,36,Almost a century later the new M_approach M_to punishment M_in the community M_outlined by the White Paper once again M_presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention .
alp-fragment01,37,"‰Û÷ Alcohol ‰Ûª , the White Paper M_states , ‰Û÷ is implicated M_in a M_wide variety of crimes , drunken driving , offences of public disorder and domestic violence ‰Ûª ( p. 21 , para. 4. 14 ) ."
alp-fragment01,38,M_In M_describing its M_vision of effective supervision the White Paper M_goes M_on to M_note :
alp-fragment01,39,offenders M_take M_part M_in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly .
alp-fragment01,40,"They learn M_about the relative M_strength of different drinks , the amount which is safe to consume , and the pitfalls to avoid ( e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‰Û÷ M_rounds ‰Ûª ) ( p. 37 , para. 7.11 ) ."
alp-fragment01,41,"As a summary of alcohol education programmes , M_this is something of a simplification ."
alp-fragment01,42,However it does M_provide a useful M_introduction M_to the origins of the Alcohol Education M_Course reported here .
alp-fragment01,43,"Furthermore , it M_highlights the suitability of referring M_to M_this type of project for M_testing M_out the appropriateness of M_applying the notion of punishment M_to probation practice ."
alp-fragment01,44,"M_In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was M_faced M_with the fact that nearly one M_in three of the offenders supervised M_in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol ( Singer , 1985 ) ."
alp-fragment01,45,"Aware of practitioners ' frustration M_in not being able to work effectively with M_these problematic clients , Probation M_management , M_in partnership M_with the voluntary M_sector , determined to develop an Alcohol Education M_Course ( AEC ) ."
alp-fragment01,46,"M_By 1986 , when social inquiry report monitoring information M_covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- as for post-sentence clients , that is , alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem M_in twenty-nine per cent of cases , a specialist project worker had been appointed ."
alp-fragment01,47,M_Towards the M_end of 1986 an AEC was M_launched and has been M_running ever since .
alp-fragment01,48,The M_aim of the M_course is to educate offenders M_about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change M_in their subsequent use of M_this drug .
alp-fragment01,49,"M_This M_aim is M_underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not M_without M_significance how they complement and M_serve to implement the White Paper 's own trinity of ‰Û÷ M_aims of supervision ‰Ûª , that is , protection of the public , prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender M_in the community ( p. 35 , para. 7.3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,50,M_These were :
alp-fragment01,51,1 .
alp-fragment01,52,To M_increase knowledge M_about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent .
alp-fragment01,53,2 .
alp-fragment01,54,To instil or M_reinforce responsible drinking M_attitudes and behaviour .
alp-fragment01,55,3 .
alp-fragment01,56,"To M_encourage the M_maintenance of , or , M_where appropriate , a reduction M_to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake ."
alp-fragment01,57,"To M_meet M_these objectives the AEC M_has a structured programme involving group and individual M_contact , that is , six group sessions M_sandwiched M_between one-to-one interviews M_held immediately M_before and M_after the group ."
alp-fragment01,58,"The initial one-to-one meeting , M_held with one of the two group leaders , M_serves to clarify what participants can expect M_from the M_course and what is expected of them ."
alp-fragment01,59,A M_standard contract which M_covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments M_between group sessions is signed by each participant .
alp-fragment01,60,"The final interview M_entails a personalized review of the M_course , as well as the M_formulation of a follow-up M_plan to be undertaken with the offender 's supervising officer ."
alp-fragment01,61,"The M_course M_employs a variety of M_materials and techniques M_including the use of checklists , magazine and newspaper clippings , quizzes , videos , brainstorm M_exercises , discussions , drink diaries , and role plays ( Menary , 1986 ) ."
alp-fragment01,62,The AEC is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation M_order M_with a special condition of attendance ( Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982 ) and M_reflects the fact that most Somerset offenders M_in trouble M_through drink M_commit M_serious offences and/or possess a M_substantial number of previous convictions .
alp-fragment01,63,"In short , they are seriously M_at risk of M_committing M_further offences and becoming trapped M_in the M_revolving M_door of custody ."
alp-fragment01,64,The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office 's recent guidance M_to sentencers :
alp-fragment01,65,M_In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing M_resources M_to M_supervising the more M_serious and persistent offenders .
alp-fragment01,66,"Probation M_orders which are M_combined M_with M_constructive , disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who M_stand to receive custodial sentences ( 1990b , p. 35 ) ."
alp-fragment01,67,M_From the M_description of the AEC already M_given the M_demanding and disciplined M_nature of the M_course can be appreciated .
alp-fragment01,68,"However , the M_course is not punitive ; M_it is not M_concerned M_with the infliction of M_pain ."
alp-fragment01,69,"Instead , M_it is M_concerned M_with the establishment of M_rules ."
alp-fragment01,70,M_This is M_plainly evident M_from the M_section of the contract signed by each participant M_where what is expected of them is M_spelt M_out :
alp-fragment01,71,"You will be expected to keep a drink diary M_throughout the M_course , and M_make attempts M_at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels ."
alp-fragment01,72,You must be willing to be helped and help others ‰ÛÓ your experiences will be useful M_to other group M_members .
alp-fragment01,73,"You must attend 8 sessions ( M_these will consist of : an introductory session , six group sessions and a final assessment interview ) ."
alp-fragment01,74,You must not drink M_before the session .
alp-fragment01,75,You must be M_on time ‰ÛÓ lateness will M_count as an absence .
alp-fragment01,76,"Unlike the prison inmate , AEC participants can not M_sit M_back and passively M_do their time ."
alp-fragment01,77,"Probation practice is not , however , solely M_concerned M_with the establishment of M_rules ."
alp-fragment01,78,"As has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation M_setting ( Singer , 1989 ) , the supervision of offenders involves two overarching M_aims : namely M_support and surveillance ."
alp-fragment01,79,M_Support refers M_to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems : surveillance M_to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform M_to socially acceptable M_standards of behaviour .
alp-fragment01,80,M_These M_aims are implemented M_through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods .
alp-fragment01,81,"In terms of M_support , there is counselling and assisting : in terms of surveillance , there is directing and monitoring ."
alp-fragment01,82,Each of M_these four methods are M_employed during the eight sessions .
alp-fragment01,83,"Although summarized as an alcohol education M_course , the sessions are not just M_concerned M_with M_giving information but also M_with enabling participants to M_make practical use of it ."
alp-fragment01,84,"M_In the first group session the counselling method is registered M_in the M_course tutor 's notes ( Menary , 1986 ) by the explanation : ‰Û÷ M_This session M_aims to M_get participants to consider the M_subject of alcohol M_in M_ways they had not thought of M_in the past ‰Ûª ( p. 3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,85,During M_this session the importance of monitoring is also M_emphasized :
alp-fragment01,86,"Drinks M_exercises M_introduce the notion of measurement , concentration of alcohol content ; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the M_course ( p. 3 ) ."
alp-fragment01,87,"M_In the fifth group session entitled ‰Û÷ M_Focus M_on the Individual ‰Ûª , the counselling and the monitoring combine M_with the directing and assisting methods ."
alp-fragment01,88,M_At the start of the session the tutor 's notes M_make M_clear that M_directing M_extends M_beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance :
alp-fragment01,89,M_This session M_allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries M_over the last five weeks ‰ÛÓ identifying the risky circumstances or M_situations ‰Û_ .
alp-fragment01,90,The M_aim M_at the M_end of the session is to encourage participants to M_make rules for their future drinking which will M_lead M_to a lessening of identified problems ( p. 4 ) .
alp-fragment01,91,"Similarly , the assisting M_extends M_beyond simply providing handouts of useful information :"
alp-fragment01,92,It is important that participants are provided with the skills to M_reduce their drinking levels or M_handle more effectively ‰Û÷ pub centred ‰Ûª problems .
alp-fragment01,93,"The use of role play , incorporating previously discussed difficulties ( i.e. homework assignment session 4 ) in ‰Û÷ real ‰Ûª or M_set M_up M_situations provides an opportunity for testing M_these skills ."
alp-fragment01,94,Probably the best M_illustration of the assisting method M_in action during the M_course M_comes M_in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners M_take the logic of working M_with the problem M_in the community M_to its ultimate conclusion .
alp-fragment01,95,"M_In the second M_half of the session , M_course leaders sponsor participants M_to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks ."
alp-fragment01,96,"The counselling , assisting , directing , and monitoring M_on the AEC M_give M_substance M_to the M_aims of M_support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a M_model of probation practice ."
alp-fragment01,97,Punishment M_has no M_place M_in M_this M_model .
alp-fragment01,98,Instead the AEC can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice .
alp-fragment01,99,"Twenty years ago the Advisory Council M_on the Penal M_System M_observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord M_with ‰Û÷ the British concept of probation as an alternative to , rather than a M_suspension of , punishment ‰Ûª ( quoted M_in Bochel , 1976 , p. 238 ) ."
alp-fragment01,100,Twenty years later the AEC M_demonstrates that M_this remains no less true now than it was then .
alp-fragment01,101,But does the AEC M_work ?
amm-fragment02,1593,M_BRINGING FOSSILS M_BACK M_TO M_LIFE
amm-fragment02,1594,"M_In M_this chapter some of the M_ways M_in which palaeontologists determine the M_way fossil animals lived are described , M_reanimating the dead fragments to M_build M_up a M_living M_creature ."
amm-fragment02,1595,"Since popular ideas of life M_in the past are often M_founded M_on M_vividly M_coloured M_reconstructions of ‰Û÷ The World M_in the Jurassic Period ‰Ûª and the like , it is important to remember that M_these imaginative M_scenes are all inferences M_from bones , and similar fragments ."
amm-fragment02,1596,"M_In fact there is nothing M_fixed M_about such interpretations , because the M_way the fossils are understood may M_change M_over the years , but it is usually some time before new discoveries M_percolate M_into the popular presentations ."
amm-fragment02,1597,Even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have M_changed their M_habits M_in the last few years !
amm-fragment02,1598,Many different M_lines of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils .
amm-fragment02,1599,The first of M_these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered .
amm-fragment02,1600,"The sediments themselves M_reveal much M_about the environment of deposition , as was M_shown M_in Chapter 3 ."
amm-fragment02,1601,"It is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which M_furnished its sedimentary cover , or whether its remains were M_swept in from some other place ."
amm-fragment02,1602,Fortunately it is usually easy to spot such M_intruders .
amm-fragment02,1603,"The type of sediment and the associated fossils will M_show whether the environment was marine , freshwater or terrestrial , providing the basic information M_into which the ecology of the animal has to be M_accommodated ."
amm-fragment02,1604,The sediments themselves may have M_preserved some of the tracks left by the animal ( p. 20 ) to M_give M_direct evidence of its past M_activities .
amm-fragment02,1605,"M_From the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal M_stance of certain dinosaurs , and to measure their M_stride ."
amm-fragment02,1606,"The M_character of the rocks , and their setting M_in the past geography M_at the time when they accumulated , M_diagnoses the climatic setting M_in which the extinct fauna lived , and climate M_imposes certain M_restraints M_on possible modes of life ."
amm-fragment02,1607,"Savannah animals differ M_from M_those of tropical rain forests , and M_these again M_from M_inhabitants of the tundra M_at M_high latitudes ."
amm-fragment02,1608,"Looking M_at the fossil animal itself , the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible M_from its fragmentary remains ."
amm-fragment02,1609,"Sometimes M_this is a very complex business , particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones ."
amm-fragment02,1610,To M_proceed M_from the M_reconstruction M_to an M_assessment of probable life M_habits two different but complementary M_approaches are used .
amm-fragment02,1611,One method M_attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal M_with living analogues .
amm-fragment02,1612,M_These do not have to be biologically M_related organisms .
amm-fragment02,1613,The basic argument is that structures that are M_closely similar were probably adapted M_to a similar function .
amm-fragment02,1614,"Sometimes M_these similarities are quite obvious : the M_ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting M_habits , M_with hardly a glance M_at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores ."
amm-fragment02,1615,"But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth M_in other mammals , M_in which M_opposing teeth M_co-operate M_in action , and which can be matched M_in extinct , M_unrelated mammals , is a much more subtle matter , involving detailed studies M_on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones ."
amm-fragment02,1616,"The technique of ‰Û÷ M_hunt the analogue ‰Ûª is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists , but it is certainly not a foolproof one , because there are many fossil animals that M_defy comparison M_with living organisms , and some analogues do not M_stand M_up M_to detailed scrutiny ."
amm-fragment02,1617,The second method M_tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a M_piece of M_engineering .
amm-fragment02,1618,"If the fossil is constructed M_in a certain M_way , then there are only a limited number of ‰Û÷ M_jobs ‰Ûª that the structure could M_perform ."
amm-fragment02,1619,The idea M_here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one .
amm-fragment02,1620,M_This M_assumes that nature only M_manufactures efficient M_designs .
amm-fragment02,1621,For the most part M_this is a reasonable assumption to M_make .
amm-fragment02,1622,"Most animals M_today do seem to have bodies that M_accord well M_with the functions they have to carry out to survive : M_flyers are aerodynamically efficient , active M_swimmers have suitable streamlining , herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food , and so on ."
amm-fragment02,1623,"Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out M_these various functions M_in experiments , but the number of examples M_where the analysis has been M_pursued M_this M_far are limited ."
amm-fragment02,1624,Of course it can never be known whether the right M_answer has been M_reached ( unless somebody dredges up a ‰Û÷ living fossil ‰Ûª from the depths of the ocean ) ‰ÛÓ there are only varying degrees of probability .
amm-fragment02,1625,"But the best M_answers are probably M_obtained M_where the functional M_design of the fossil M_points M_to the same life M_habits as a living analogue , and M_where both are M_consistent M_with the geological circumstances M_in which the fossil remains occur ."
amm-fragment02,1626,SWIMMING TRILOBITES
amm-fragment02,1627,There are thousands of different kinds of trilobites .
amm-fragment02,1628,All of them were marine and all of them are extinct .
amm-fragment02,1629,"Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed M_at any one time they were probably M_occupying different ecological M_niches , behaving in different M_ways , corresponding M_with the M_wide variation M_in shape that they M_show ."
amm-fragment02,1630,"We can use the methods described M_above to elucidate some of M_these M_occupations , and M_get a M_glimpse , albeit an imperfect one , of the trilobite as it lived ."
amm-fragment02,1631,"I will M_take an example M_where all the methods can be used , and M_where all M_point M_in the same M_direction , so that the M_answer is probably correct ."
amm-fragment02,1632,"Most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide , not greatly convex , and with eyes that M_occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head ."
amm-fragment02,1633,"There are a few trilobite species , however , with enormous , globular eyes ( see M_below ) ."
amm-fragment02,1634,By examining the M_way M_these animals were M_put M_together it is possible to suggest a likely M_mode of life .
amm-fragment02,1635,"Giant-eyed Ordovician trilobite , seen M_from the top and side ."
amm-fragment02,1636,Twice its natural size .
amm-fragment02,1637,Enlargement M_shows a section through the lenses to M_show the direction of the M_field of view .
amm-fragment02,1638,We can M_take the eyes first .
amm-fragment02,1639,"The trilobite eye was of a compound type , and each lens was M_made M_up of a calcite crystal ."
amm-fragment02,1640,M_From the optical properties of M_this mineral we know that the lens was M_able to M_interpret light M_coming M_from a direction more or less M_at right-angles M_to the lens surface .
amm-fragment02,1641,"So we can deduce what the M_field of vision of M_our globular-eyed trilobite was , by looking M_at the directions M_in which all the lenses face ."
amm-fragment02,1642,"It M_turns M_out that M_our animal was M_able to see M_in almost every direction ‰ÛÓ upwards , downwards , sideways and forwards , and even backwards , because the eyes bulged out beyond the M_line of the rest of the body ."
amm-fragment02,1643,Most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral M_field of view .
amm-fragment02,1644,"If the animal lived on the sea bottom , it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards , and we begin to M_suspect that the animal M_habitually dwelt above the sea floor ."
amm-fragment02,1645,Other features of its shape are M_consistent M_with M_this .
amm-fragment02,1646,"At the‰ÛÒ edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines , and M_these M_point downwards M_at a steep angle , at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor ."
amm-fragment02,1647,"Most ‰Û÷ normal ‰Ûª trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin , which may have rested on the sediment surface ."
amm-fragment02,1648,The thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared M_with the average trilobite ( compare Fig. 33 ) .
amm-fragment02,1649,"The convex , middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that M_operated the appendages ( which , as usual , are not preserved ) , and the relatively large volume of M_this region M_shows that the musculature was powerful ."
amm-fragment02,1650,"The construction of M_this giant-eyed trilobite M_suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom , and possibly in the surface waters of the sea ."
amm-fragment02,1651,"Of course because there are no living trilobites we can not M_find M_direct confirmation of M_this hypothesis , but we can M_look for other arthropods that have the same M_modifications of the eyes , for example , in the present day oceans ."
amm-fragment02,1652,"The analogy is M_found M_in such ocean-going amphipods ( a kind of ‰Û÷ shrimp ‰Ûª ) as Cystosoma , which also M_has enormously expanded eyes , looking like M_headlamps , compared M_with its bottom-dwelling M_relatives ( see M_above ) ."
amm-fragment02,1653,"M_In fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water M_column have large , globular eyes of M_this kind ."
amm-fragment02,1654,"49 Fossil bony fish , Lates gracilis , Eocene ."
amm-fragment02,1655,M_This fish is preserved in a fine-grained limestone which M_preserved most of the skeletal details of the fish ( but not its colours ) .
amm-fragment02,1656,"M_This is a stout-bodied fish , something like a perch in general proportions , with long , low fins on upper and lower rear of the body ( fin M_rays finely divide near their ends ) ."
amm-fragment02,1657,Head to tail the fish measures 17 cm .
amm-fragment02,1658,"50 Vertebra of the Jurassic pliosaur , Liopleurodon species , Kimmeridge , southern England ."
amm-fragment02,1659,M_This is only one vertebra of an animal much too bulky to appear M_in a book of M_this size !

amm-fragment02,1662,"51 Fossil frog , Rana species , Miocene , Spain ."
amm-fragment02,1663,"M_This species is preserved in a soft shale , but one which M_allows for the skeletal anatomy to be preserved M_in its entirety ."
amm-fragment02,1664,"The outline of the soft parts are also clearly displayed , so that the animal has been preserved almost M_in M_frozen motion ."
amm-fragment02,1665,Frogs are one of the more numerous of amphibian fossils .

amm-fragment02,1731,M_These beautifully preserved flowers are from the Oeningen deposits like the maple leaf and seeds M_illustrated M_here .
amm-fragment02,1732,Fossil flowers are extremely rare because of their delicacy and because they are shortlived .
amm-fragment02,1733,"M_These flowers M_have five oval petals , finely M_veined ."
amm-fragment02,1734,No details of the stamens are present M_in the fossil state .
amm-fragment02,1735,Diameter of the flowers is M_about 2 cm .
amm-fragment02,1736,Giant-eyed living crustacean ( Cystosoma )
amm-fragment02,1737,"If it is correct that M_our trilobite lived above the sea bottom , actively swimming in the water , there are certain predictions we can M_make M_about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks ."
amm-fragment02,1738,"Most bottom-dwelling trilobites M_preferred to live at a particular water depth , or on a particular type of sea bottom ( mud , sand or lime ) ."
amm-fragment02,1739,No such restriction should apply M_to M_our large-eyed species ; it should be M_found M_with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages M_without preference .
amm-fragment02,1740,"M_This has been proved in several places : in some arctic localities it is M_found M_with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the Ordovician ocean , while in Canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas , where limestones were accumulating ."
amm-fragment02,1741,"By the same M_token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to M_have a very wide geographical distribution , for oceans would be no M_barrier M_to it ."
amm-fragment02,1742,"And again M_this proves to be the case : M_our example is found in Arctic Canada , in the high Arctic island of Spitsbergen , thousands of miles away in what is M_now the desert country of Nevada and Utah in the United States , in western Ireland , in Russia , and in northwestern Australia ."
amm-fragment02,1743,"So M_in M_this case the different M_sources of evidence all M_point M_in the same M_direction , whether derived M_from a detailed consideration of the M_way the trilobite is M_constructed , or by analogy M_with living animals M_with similar adaptations , or M_from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils ."
amm-fragment02,1744,"M_These giant-eyed trilobites of the Ordovician were active M_swimmers in the surface waters , as M_near certainly as we can ever know ."
amm-fragment02,1745,"There are all kinds of different questions we can ask M_about the life M_habits of M_these trilobites , which are not subject to the same kind of M_careful scrutiny ."
amm-fragment02,1746,"What did they eat , for example ?"
amm-fragment02,1747,"Because we do not have the legs preserved , it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned M_in feeding , and neither are the stomach contents preserved ."
amm-fragment02,1748,So M_here there are only more or less likely speculations .
amm-fragment02,1749,"Active M_swimmers in the surface waters of the M_present oceans are likely to feed directly M_on the plankton , and the trilobites may have M_had a method of M_harvesting M_large quantities of minute food ."
amm-fragment02,1750,"Or they may have been hunters M_after larger prey , M_in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to M_have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food ."
amm-fragment02,1751,"M_Puzzles M_remain , even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story ."
amm-fragment02,1752,CONTROVERSY M_AMONG THE GIANT DINOSAURS
amm-fragment02,1753,The giant sauropod dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus were the largest land animals the world has M_seen they weighed more than 80 tonnes and M_present quite different problems M_in the interpretation of their life M_habits M_from the diminutive trilobites .
amm-fragment02,1754,"Such spectacular animals have obviously M_attracted much attention , and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago ."
amm-fragment02,1755,"Most of the popular books M_showing the Mesozoic M_giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation , their bodies largely under water ."
amm-fragment02,1756,"Surely an animal of M_this bulk , it was argued , must be partly supported by water , and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft , luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps ."
amm-fragment02,1757,Because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary ( see p. 115 ) to totally submerge .
amm-fragment02,1758,Recently the life M_habits of the M_giants have been M_looked M_at M_in a M_way that M_disproves most of these traditional notions .
amm-fragment02,1759,Consider the M_structure of their legs .
amm-fragment02,1760,"The sauropods have relatively long , M_pillar-like legs , resembling M_those of the elephant , the largest living land animal , and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal ."
amm-fragment02,1761,"The feet of the sauropod are small ( relatively M_speaking ! ) , with short , stubby toes , yet animals that walk on soft mud M_tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly ."
amm-fragment02,1762,"It is difficult to M_see how the compact feet of the sauropod could M_avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft , muddy bottom of a lake ."
amm-fragment02,1763,"If the dinosaur did , M_after all , live on dry land , then the long neck could have usefully functioned to M_allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees ( see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1764,It has been suggested that an animal of the size of Brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs .
amm-fragment02,1765,"Their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants , which are generally accepted as terrestrial ."
amm-fragment02,1766,There is even some evidence M_from the tracks they have left behind that Diplodocus and its M_allies moved about in herds .
amm-fragment02,1767,"They may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant , and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull , M_with the nostrils M_in M_this case M_sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have M_had a proboscis of some sort ."
amm-fragment02,1768,The M_balance of evidence seems to be M_swinging M_away M_from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs M_to fully terrestrial M_habits .
amm-fragment02,1769,But other M_aspects of the dinosaur living M_habits are still more M_strongly debated .
amm-fragment02,1770,"M_In the last few years a M_powerful controversy has M_arisen M_over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded , like all living reptiles ( and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles ) , or warm-blooded , resembling mammals M_in M_this respect ."
amm-fragment02,1771,Cold-blooded animals have to ‰Û÷ M_warm M_up ‰Ûª before they can be fully active ; M_that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun M_in temperate M_climates .
amm-fragment02,1772,For M_this reason they can not M_cope M_with climates M_having greatly M_extended winters .
amm-fragment02,1773,"Warm-blooded animals M_have the same body temperatures M_at all times , and can be more M_continuously active , but they M_use M_far more energy ‰ÛÓ and hence need more food ‰ÛÓ than cold-blooded animals of the same size ."
amm-fragment02,1774,"The M_posture of many dinosaurs , and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs , was fully erect M_with the legs beneath the body , and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles ( see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1775,"The long back legs of such M_hunters look highly suitable for running , and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance ( see p. 116 ) ."
amm-fragment02,1776,"For any kind of prolonged activity , warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage ."
amm-fragment02,1777,Under the microscope even the bone M_structure of M_these dinosaurs looks more like M_that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles .
amm-fragment02,1778,"M_On the other M_hand it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large , and M_with a relatively small surface area M_through which to cool compared M_with their enormous volume , that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to M_allow them to sustain more M_continuous activity than smaller , living reptiles ."
amm-fragment02,1779,"It has also been argued that the small mouths of the M_giants simply could not have downed enough food to M_support a warm-blooded metabolism , particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy ."
amm-fragment02,1780,"The M_armoured or M_plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective M_armour to have been very active , but M_this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded ."
amm-fragment02,1781,M_Protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the Cretaceous plains like M_furious M_reptilian M_rhinoceroses !
amm-fragment02,1782,"One idea M_about the life M_habits of the dinosaur M_giants , published M_in Joc and Colette at the Natural History Museum M_in 1935"
amm-fragment02,1783,The M_warm-blooded supporters M_tend to ally themselves M_with the supporters of a theory M_about the relationships of the dinosaurs .
amm-fragment02,1784,"M_This is that the dinosaurs , or a M_close dinosaur relative , included the ancestors of the living birds ."
amm-fragment02,1785,"Some of the smaller , and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were M_about the size of a chicken , and there is more than a M_passing similarity M_between a running ostrich and the kind of M_reconstruction that M_shows fleet-footed , running dinosaurs ."
amm-fragment02,1786,"The M_point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded , like mammals , and if birds and dinosaurs are as M_closely related as now seems likely , then it obviously increases the likelihood that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded ."
amm-fragment02,1787,"The M_pros and M_cons of M_this theory are the M_subject of much contentious debate by experts , but it would probably be correct to M_say that the M_greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs , including small and large carnivores , were warm-blooded , active animals ."
amm-fragment02,1788,A M_lot of the argument M_among the authorities M_on M_these animals is M_about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons ( and particularly the Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx ) ; M_this M_makes for rather M_dry reading for the M_layman .
amm-fragment02,1789,"But the M_end-product is the M_accurate M_reconstruction of the Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial M_world , M_over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant ."

as6-fragment01,2,Susanne MacGregor and Ben Pimlott
as6-fragment01,3,The essays M_in M_this book do not M_amount M_to a programme : but they are intended to provide a M_springboard for one .
as6-fragment01,4,The M_aim is to analyse a problem which economic M_growth alone has M_failed to M_cure ‰ÛÓ and to M_consider possible new M_forms of public action .
as6-fragment01,5,"The M_biggest single difficulty M_in M_drawing attention M_to urban poverty is that it is not new , but simply ‰ÛÓ M_in some of its most worrying manifestations ‰ÛÓ getting worse ."
as6-fragment01,6,"Like the poor themselves , the inner city has long been M_with us ."
as6-fragment01,7,"Ever since the Industrial Revolution created a mass urban society , the M_conditions of the poorest city dwellers have M_given M_rise M_to anxiety M_among the better off ."
as6-fragment01,8,"The inner city has been variously M_regarded as a cause for moral outrage , a M_threat M_to public M_order , or as a M_stain M_on the nation 's M_conscience ."
as6-fragment01,9,"Meanwhile bad housing , bad sanitation , lack of education , and other M_perennial ills associated M_with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers ."
as6-fragment01,10,"A M_central objective of the post-war welfare state was , indeed , to alleviate the problems of the urban poor , M_over whom Beveridge 's Five M_Giants ( Want , Disease , Ignorance , Squalor , and Idleness ) had for so long M_held M_sway ."
as6-fragment01,11,"M_In the early 1940s and 1950s , the belief was widely M_held that a combination of government intervention ‰ÛÓ M_in the M_form of town planning , housing and health programmes , and the M_provision of social security ‰ÛÓ and permanent male M_full employment , M_together M_with an increase M_in real wages , would M_reduce suffering due to poverty M_to manageable M_proportions ."
as6-fragment01,12,"The 1964 Labour Government was elected M_on a M_tide of impatience M_at the M_slackening M_pace of social reform , but also of optimism that little more than economic M_growth , M_fuelled by technological change , was needed to M_remove the main causes of urban deprivation ( MacGregor , 1981 ) ."
as6-fragment01,13,Disillusion M_swiftly M_followed .
as6-fragment01,14,"The work of Peter Townsend and others M_showed that , M_far M_from presiding M_over the M_elimination of poverty , the Wilson Government actually M_failed to M_prevent some of its M_features M_from worsening ( Townsend and Bosanquet , 1972 ) ."
as6-fragment01,15,Evidence began to M_mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it M_solved .
as6-fragment01,16,"Neither the Butler Education Act of 1944 , nor the M_introduction of comprehensive schools , M_prevented a M_high M_proportion of children M_from M_under-achieving ."
as6-fragment01,17,"Post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to M_do nothing to M_prevent , and seemed even to M_encourage , a M_rise M_in crime and mental illness ."
as6-fragment01,18,"Meanwhile , in many parts of the country , a problem as M_old as cities themselves ‰ÛÓ M_tension M_between cultural M_groups , M_between earlier immigrants and newer ones , M_between black , brown , and white , and ( increasingly ) M_between M_large M_sections of urban youth and the police ‰ÛÓ M_came to be identified as the key inner-city issue ."
as6-fragment01,19,M_Rising unemployment M_turned a lingering and M_growing M_malaise M_into a M_crisis .
as6-fragment01,20,"As in the United States , so in Britain it was an outbreak of violence that M_dramatically M_brought the plight of the inner cities M_to public notice ."
as6-fragment01,21,"M_In the early 1980s , M_at a time when manufacturing industry was M_collapsing and the M_outlook for the unskilled M_looked particularly M_bleak , frustration M_boiled M_over M_in a series of riots in London , Bristol , Birmingham , Liverpool , and elsewhere ."
as6-fragment01,22,"All were spontaneous outbursts : none , contrary to some claims , were politically inspired or M_orchestrated ( except in Northern Ireland where urban problems existed M_on a grander , more M_devastating M_scale , and where there was a unique heritage ) ."
as6-fragment01,23,"Many M_had an ‰Û÷ ethnic ‰Ûª M_dimension , M_in the M_sense that many of the rioters were black ."
as6-fragment01,24,"Unlike , however , the 1958 Notting Hill riots , few of M_those involved were immigrants ‰ÛÓ the M_vast majority were British born ."
as6-fragment01,25,And the disturbances could not strictly be called racial : the most M_prominent M_feature was M_that of M_violent M_clashes M_between young people and the police .
as6-fragment01,26,"The problems , however , were not M_confined M_to M_violent upheavals of M_this kind ."
as6-fragment01,27,"Paul Harrison 's Inside the Inner City : Life M_under the M_Cutting M_Edge M_focused M_on Hackney , a London borough M_ranked M_among the worst off M_on any M_scale of urban deprivation ( Harrison , 1983 ) ."
as6-fragment01,28,"Harrison describes ( p. 369 ) the M_way M_in which the inner urban powder-keg M_leads M_to a M_vicious M_circle , M_with many M_victims , but few individual M_villains :"
as6-fragment01,29,The police force M_face the virtually impossible task of M_keeping the M_lid M_on the M_explosive M_mixture of M_ingredients that the M_dynamics of British society have M_assembled in the inner city .
as6-fragment01,30,"M_This M_mixture , M_heated by recession and M_high unemployment , inevitably M_generates a M_high M_level of crime ."
as6-fragment01,31,"M_This necessitates , M_in M_turn , a M_far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area , M_far more frequent unpleasant M_contact M_with the public as potential suspects , and M_far M_greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse ."
as6-fragment01,32,"The inevitable sufferers , of course , are the poor , of whom M_those who actually M_commit the offences that concern the police are a M_tiny minority and whom , indeed , it should be the purpose of the police to protect ."
as6-fragment01,33,"Not only are the most disadvantaged M_on the M_receiving M_end of most crime , argues Harrison , they also have to put up M_with the M_heaviest police presence ."
as6-fragment01,34,"They are more likely to be stopped and searched , and to be the M_victim of mistaken arrest or conviction ."
as6-fragment01,35,"M_At the same time , the residents of the poorest areas have to M_suffer , M_in a M_way that is not true of M_those who live elsewhere , a M_growing fear of attack M_on themselves or their property ."
as6-fragment01,36,"Improved police methods might M_help , writes Harrison , to M_contain the problem ."
as6-fragment01,37,"But , M_without other changes , the result is likely to be a ‰Û÷ society of M_barricaded self-defence , and a M_steady M_erosion of civil M_liberties ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment01,38,"And he concludes , ‰Û÷ of all the warnings that the inner city has to M_offer for the M_direction British society is M_taking , M_this is perhaps the most sinister ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment01,39,"Harrison 's M_vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities , M_locked in a M_cold or M_hot war M_between have-nots and the M_forces of public M_order , was echoed by Robert Chesshyre ( 1987 , p. 95 ) , who concluded that M_by the late 1980s :"
as6-fragment01,40,"The basic social contract , whereby citizens M_enjoy certain rights ‰ÛÓ including health care , M_decent education and housing and a job ‰ÛÓ in return for which they M_observe the M_rule of law , was M_breaking M_down ."
as6-fragment01,41,"As a consequence an underclass was M_evolving ‰ÛÓ football hooligans , muggers , inner city rioters ‰ÛÓ somewhat more frightening than their Dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible ."
as6-fragment01,42,"Recently , of course , there has been an M_added M_dimension ‰ÛÓ part media-and-politician M_inflated , part real : drugs ."
as6-fragment01,43,"The M_spiral M_in drug abuse and trafficking , M_with M_direct consequences for the AIDS epidemic , has created a new kind of alarm ."
as6-fragment01,44,"The early 1980s M_witnessed a radical change M_in M_patterns of heroin taking , M_alongside the global increase ."
as6-fragment01,45,Smoking heroin ( ‰Û÷ M_chasing the M_dragon ‰Ûª ) was one M_feature of the upsurge .
as6-fragment01,46,"Another was the increased availability of , and demand for , cocaine ."
as6-fragment01,47,"Sensational media and police reports M_in 1989 seemed to M_suggest an increased use of ‰Û÷ M_crack ‰Ûª M_among young people in parts of south London , Liverpool , and Birmingham ‰ÛÓ M_with M_attendant fears that M_this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread , as it was reported to be in parts of the United States ."
as6-fragment01,48,"for the moment , however , the M_pattern of drug abuse in Britain remains as varied as ever ‰ÛÓ with M_home-produced drugs such as amphetamines as M_serious a problem as M_those that M_hit the headlines ."
as6-fragment01,49,"It is a M_symptom of public anxiety M_about urban squalor ‰ÛÓ and , less creditably , of class and racial prejudice ‰ÛÓ that ‰Û÷ drugs ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ inner cities ‰Ûª are M_automatically M_linked M_in the popular M_consciousness ( MacGregor , 1989a ) ."
as6-fragment01,50,"Nevertheless , drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction , are especially M_serious in areas of city poverty ( Burr , 1989 ) ."
as6-fragment01,51,"In short , if life was always M_harder in the inner cities than elsewhere , and if M_conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the M_impact of the welfare state and M_rising incomes , the last decade has been widely M_represented as a period of deterioration ."
as6-fragment01,52,"Moreover , few would dispute that M_this apparent decline is a reality : the first words of the Prime Minister herself , M_after the result of the 1987 election was known , were an acknowledgement of the M_challenge posed M_to Government by the ‰Û÷ inner cities ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment01,53,What has been lacking however ‰ÛÓ as well as the political will to do something ‰ÛÓ has been any M_shared agreement M_on the cause .
as6-fragment01,54,Can the problems of urban poverty be blamed M_on individual pathology ?
as6-fragment01,55,M_On feckless parents and grandparents ?
as6-fragment01,56,"Or M_on the social or physical M_environment ‰ÛÓ the replacement of M_companionably unhygienic slums by M_soulless tower blocks with broken lifts ( Coleman et al . ,"
as6-fragment01,57,1985 ) ?
as6-fragment01,58,"Or would a simple M_injection of M_resources transform Kafkaesque M_honeycombs M_into M_happy living-spaces , M_with a consequent decline M_in inner-city ills ?"

as6-fragment01,61,"Same building ‰ÛÓ just a matter of money and management ‰Ûª ( Parkin , 1989 ) ."
as6-fragment01,62,The M_view that only ‰Û÷ outstanding management ‰Ûª could M_meet the problem was M_held by the Audit Commission ( 1987 ) .
as6-fragment01,63,The M_picture M_painted by the Commission 's report M_on inner London is as gruesome as any ever M_presented ( and is itself M_revealing of common prejudices M_in its choice of indicators of deprivation ) :
as6-fragment01,64,"In some London boroughs , unemployment M_among young men exceeds 45% ; in some places , M_among young blacks , it exceeds 60% ."

as6-fragment01,68,"M_Drawing M_on North American experience , the Commission M_concluded that ‰Û÷ M_poor management was an important contributory M_factor M_to New York 's problems ‰Ûª , and M_sought to M_apply the same lessons M_here ( p. 2 ) ."
as6-fragment01,69,"The Government 's post-1987 initiatives have , M_to some M_extent , M_reflected a M_diagnosis M_based M_on the need for better management ‰ÛÓ though M_on the principle that M_central authorities can provide a M_firmer M_grip than local ones ‰ÛÓ but M_combined M_with an anti-collectivist belief M_in the restorative M_powers of capitalism ."
as6-fragment01,70,"Leech and Amin ( 1988 , p. 14 ) summarize M_this M_approach , not unfairly , M_in the M_following terms :"
as6-fragment01,71,"the encouragement of private investment and the M_liberation of the M_market ; the containment of the M_forces of social discontent ; the M_control of the M_powers of the local authorities ; and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating M_buffer areas of Tory M_support , M_accentuating inequalities and injustice and ( hopefully though not necessarily ) M_reducing the potential for conflict M_among the urban poor ."
as6-fragment01,72,"The main M_thrust of the Government 's policy is M_contained M_in the January 1988 White Paper M_on Regional Policy and the Enterprise Economy , M_in the new Employment M_Training programme , and especially M_in the March 1988 Action for Cities programme ‰ÛÓ all M_resting M_on M_wider reforms M_to local government M_structure and finance , and M_to education and housing ."
as6-fragment01,73,"The most striking M_feature of M_this M_package , apart from its M_aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs , is a M_sharp M_reduction M_in the M_role of local government ."
as6-fragment01,74,"Despite the contemporary M_tone of much of Action for Cities , the programme 's heritage can be M_traced M_to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 Milner‰ÛÒHolland Report M_on housing and the 1967 Plowden Report M_on education , as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established ."
as6-fragment01,75,"The 1970s ‰Û÷ Urban Programme ‰Ûª M_had a social , rather than economic , M_emphasis and was M_administered by the Home Office ."
as6-fragment01,76,"It was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by Enoch Powell 's 1969 ‰Û÷ rivers of blood ‰Ûª speech , much as disturbances M_at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival M_prompted further M_steps on the part of the Department of the Environment ‰ÛÓ ‰Û÷ A riot M_makes a much M_bigger M_impact M_on government thinking ‰Ûª , as Donnison ( 1987 ) has M_pointed M_out , ‰Û÷ than any amount of M_earnest and M_accurate research ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment01,77,"The Urban Programme consisted of grants and initiatives M_under the 1969 Local Government Grants ( Social Need ) Act , which was intended as a M_flexible M_instrument to provide supplementary help M_to local authorities M_in the M_fields of housing , education , and health ."
as6-fragment01,78,"Originally , the Programme supplemented existing M_central and local government schemes M_designed to M_meet special needs in urban areas ."
as6-fragment01,79,"The scope was M_extended M_in an ‰Û÷ enhanced ‰Ûª Urban Programme , which included economic and environmental as well as social projects , and was specifically M_directed M_at the inner urban areas where the problems were most M_severe ."
as6-fragment01,80,"Earlier , the change of M_emphasis M_from a ‰Û÷ social ‰Ûª M_to an ‰Û÷ economic and environmental ‰Ûª M_focus had been M_reflected M_in a M_switch of responsibility for the Programme M_from the Home Office M_to the Department of the Environment ."
as6-fragment01,81,"The ‰Û÷ enhanced Programme resulted M_from the 1978 Inner Urban Areas Act , M_based M_on a White Paper , published the previous year , M_on Policy for the Inner Cities ( DoE , 1977 ) , the first comprehensive policy statement M_on the M_subject to acknowledge it as a M_definable and cohesive problem ."
as6-fragment01,82,"The White Paper M_drew M_on studies M_conducted earlier M_in the decade in Liverpool , Birmingham , and London which M_pointed M_to a M_debilitating M_flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation ."
as6-fragment01,83,A key M_aspect of the 1977 White Paper was the M_stress it M_placed M_on the M_wider effects of poverty : that it was not just M_those M_with acute needs who suffered .
as6-fragment01,84,"It M_argued that M_in talking M_about inner cities it was M_vital to think in terms not just of individuals , but of society ; that the multiple deprivations of the worst M_hit areas affected all the residents ; that the consequences included a pervasive M_sense of neglect and M_decay , a decline M_in community M_spirit , a M_low M_standard of neighbourhood facilities , and an increase M_in crime and vandalism ; and that , M_without government intervention , the future was one of M_reduced job opportunities , deteriorating housing , and a decline M_in public services ."
as6-fragment01,85,"The document , and the legislation that M_derived M_from it , M_pointed M_to a positively discriminatory M_approach : M_with both M_central and local government supplementing existing programmes M_in such a M_way as to M_strengthen local economies , as well as the physical and social M_environment ."
as6-fragment01,86,"Such M_measures M_constituted the present Government 's heritage , when it M_took M_office M_in 1979 ."
as6-fragment01,87,"None of them , of course , anticipated the M_scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and M_collapse of much of what M_remained of inner urban manufacturing industry M_in the early 1980s ."
as6-fragment01,88,"Neither , at first , did the M_incoming administration M_foresee the M_impact of M_rising unemployment , which was to be especially M_serious M_among the urban young ."
as6-fragment01,89,"True , the new Secretary of State for the Environment M_laid M_stress , M_from the outset , M_on the need for economic M_regeneration , and M_indicated his sympathy for the voluntary M_sector M_in the M_tackling of urban problems ."
as6-fragment01,90,"The previous Government , however , had already M_pointed M_to the need to M_revitalize urban economies , and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real ."
as6-fragment01,91,"Michael Heseltine ( 1987 , p. 138 ) has since claimed that ‰Û÷ we M_set a M_new objective : to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to M_put his money ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment01,92,Partnership became his slogan ‰ÛÓ the M_partnership of public and private brains and money .
as6-fragment01,93,"A new Urban Development Grant was devised , to pump-prime M_with public funds schemes which would then M_attract private investment ."
as6-fragment01,94,"Heseltine 's M_vision was of ‰Û÷ partnerships which M_recognise that there are some M_things that only governments can M_pay for , but also that the ingenuity and M_flexibility of the private M_sector is indispensable ‰Ûª ( p. 156 ) ."
as6-fragment01,95,"He claims that M_serious work M_on inner-city policy began M_in 1979 : but it was , undoubtedly , the riots of 1981 , coinciding M_with the M_biggest M_drop M_in employment and job vacancies since the war , which M_gave M_impetus M_to the M_new M_approach ."
as6-fragment01,96,"Urban Development Corporations were introduced M_in 1981 in London Docklands and Merseyside , and the Urban Development Grant M_came M_in late the M_following year ."
as6-fragment01,97,"Conservative instincts were , of course , to M_minimize ‰ÛÓ M_within the ‰Û÷ M_partnership ‰ÛÓ state involvement and expenditure , relative to M_that of private enterprise ."
as6-fragment01,98,"Yet , the irony of the early 1980s ‰ÛÓ as a deteriorating , but perennial , urban problem rapidly became the most acute M_aspect of the M_crisis of mass unemployment ‰ÛÓ was that a Tory government , willy-nilly , M_found itself presiding M_over an increase M_in state intervention M_through a M_variety of agencies ."
as6-fragment01,99,The increased M_scale of M_operations also M_ushered M_in another fashion of the 1980s ‰ÛÓ M_new management M_structures .
as6-fragment01,100,Thus M_in 1985 City Action> Teams were introduced M_to each ‰Û÷ Inner City Partnership ‰Ûª area to M_co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved .
as6-fragment01,101,"Task M_forces , meanwhile , were M_directed to M_tackle youth unemployment ."
as6-fragment01,102,"M_By 1986/7 the Urban Programme was M_supporting 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts M_in enterprise M_workshops ."
as6-fragment01,103,"It was providing 27,500 M_training M_places ( often in conjunction with the Manpower Services Commission ) : some 2,500 buildings were being improved ; estate action M_aimed to M_tackle run down housing ; and a M_large number of M_new ‰Û÷ partnerships ‰Ûª ( which some might M_see as subsidies , or M_discredited regional grants , M_in a M_new guise ) were M_in M_operation , M_in an effort to M_bring private investment M_to run-down urban areas ."
as6-fragment01,104,M_By 1988 it was claimed that å£200 million of Urban Development Grant and Urban M_Regeneration Grant had successfully ‰Û÷ M_levered ‰Ûª more than å£800 million of private investment M_into the inner cities ( although how much of the latter sum might have been invested M_in any case is difficult to M_say ) .
as6-fragment01,105,"Meanwhile , there were other incentive schemes ‰ÛÓ Enterprise Zones , for example , and simplified Planning Zones , which M_aimed to M_lift tax and planning ‰Û÷ M_barriers ‰Ûª in order to facilitate investment ."
as6-fragment01,106,"Indeed , while M_with one M_hand trying to M_hold M_down expenditure by local authorities , the Government M_found itself M_by the late 1980s involved M_with the other M_hand M_in M_massive ear-marked spending M_on inner urban areas ."
as6-fragment01,107,"The Department of the Environment alone M_by 1988 was M_spending M_half a billion pounds out of an Action for Cities total , involving most M_Home departments , estimated M_at å£3 billion ."
as6-fragment01,108,Perhaps a Labour government would have M_spent even more : it would certainly have M_spent it M_in different M_ways .
as6-fragment01,109,"It is a M_curious comment M_on Thatcherism , however , that the administration most M_committed M_to a M_reduction M_in the M_role of the state , and M_in the need for an M_independent private M_sector , has M_spent more M_on specific urban M_regeneration and employment schemes and incentives M_to private investment M_in urban areas than any other M_in recent history ."
as6-fragment01,110,"One of the most bizarre M_aspects of government policy has been the effective M_murder of the voluntary M_sector , and its M_appropriation , by subterfuge , M_into the Tory M_version of the corporate state ."
as6-fragment01,111,"Conservatives have always lauded the ‰Û÷ voluntarist ‰Ûª principle M_in welfare , and M_encouraged it M_from M_platforms ."
as6-fragment01,112,"M_Faced , however , M_with the M_catastrophic increase M_in unemployment and the need to M_occupy M_large numbers of workless people M_without M_directly employing them ( which would have M_run M_counter M_to the economic doctrine which had M_led M_to the redundancy of many of them M_in the first M_place ) , the Government M_poured money M_into any ‰Û÷ voluntary ‰Ûª agency M_willing to M_put M_in a bid for government-funded cheap labour ."
as6-fragment01,113,"One result was the M_triumphant M_expansion of some M_charitable organizations , which M_rejoiced both M_at their new-found importance and M_at the Government 's munificence ."
as6-fragment01,114,"Another was the transformation of many such M_bodies , already M_heavily subsidized M_from public funds , M_into de facto agencies of the state , which M_financed them and indirectly M_determined their policy ."
as6-fragment01,115,"Nowhere was the M_impact of M_this M_clumsy M_sleight of M_hand more evident than in the inner cities , where voluntary organizations had been most active , and where the Government was most M_anxious for them to M_mop M_up unemployment ."
as6-fragment01,116,"However , the later M_withdrawal of government M_support , M_with the M_scrapping of the Community Programme as unemployment M_receded , M_left many of M_these voluntary organizations M_high and M_dry ."

as6-fragment02,349,M_MAKING M_SENSE OF THE 1981 RIOTS
as6-fragment02,350,M_Reactions M_to the riots have M_concentrated M_on a M_number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred .
as6-fragment02,351,"Lord Scarman 's report M_on the 1981 M_disorders M_highlighted the importance of unemployment , urban deprivation , racial disadvantage , relations M_between young blacks and the police , the decline of civic consent , and political exclusion as the key issues ."
as6-fragment02,352,Other M_reactions have M_concentrated M_on the issue of the M_interplay M_between inner-city M_decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain .
as6-fragment02,353,"Yet others have argued that the unrest can be M_seen as a M_symptom of the M_breakdown of law and M_order M_in British society ( Gaffney , 1987 ; Hall , 1987 ; Keith , 1987 ) ."
as6-fragment02,354,The main issues that were M_prominent M_in debates during 1980‰ÛÒ1 were ‰Û÷ race ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ law and M_order ‰Ûª .
as6-fragment02,355,"M_This was by no means an accident , since M_throughout the 1970s a M_powerful M_body of media , political , and academic opinion had been M_constructed M_around the theme of how Britain was M_drifting M_into a ‰Û÷ violent society ‰Ûª , and how the basis of consent was being M_shifted by the M_pressures of immigration and the M_growth of multi-racial inner city areas ."
as6-fragment02,356,A M_glimpse of the M_impact of the 1980‰ÛÒ1 riots M_at M_this M_level can be achieved M_through two important debates M_in Parliament .
as6-fragment02,357,"The first M_took M_place M_in the M_midst of the July 1981 riots , and M_had as its theme : ‰Û÷ Civil Disturbances ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,358,"The M_tone of the debate was M_set by Home Secretary William Whitelaw 's introductory statement M_in which he spoke of ( a ) the need to ‰Û÷ M_remove the M_scourge of criminal violence M_from our streets ‰Ûª , and ( b ) the urgency of developing ‰Û÷ policies M_designed to M_promote the mutual tolerance and understanding M_upon which the M_whole future of a free democratic society depends ‰Ûª ( Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 July 1981 : col. 1405 ) ."
as6-fragment02,359,"The ‰Û÷ M_scourge of criminal violence ‰Ûª was , Whitelaw argued , a danger M_to the M_whole M_framework of consent and legality M_on which the political institutions of British society were M_based ."
as6-fragment02,360,"M_In reply Roy Hattersley M_supported the M_call for the immediate M_suppression of street violence , but warned that the M_roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people M_felt they M_had a M_stake M_in British society ( ibid. : cols. 1407‰ÛÒ9 )"
as6-fragment02,361,"The second debate M_took M_place M_on 26 November 1981 , M_on the publication of the Scarman Report , and M_had as its theme : ‰Û÷ Law and M_Order ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,362,"The importance of the riots M_in M_pushing the law and M_order issue , and specifically policing , M_on M_to the main political agenda was M_emphasized by the Liberal leader , David Steel , who argued that ‰Û÷ urgent action ‰Ûª to prevent a M_drift M_into lawlessness was necessary M_from both a moral and a political M_perspective ( Hansard , vol. 13 , 26 November 1981 : cols. 1009‰ÛÒ11 ) ."
as6-fragment02,363,"A subsequent debate M_on the same issue M_in March 1982 was also M_full of references M_to the experience of 1981 , the M_impact of street violence , crime , M_decaying urban conditions , the M_breakdown of consent M_between the police and many local communities , and the M_spectre of ‰Û÷ more violence to come ‰Ûª if changes M_in both policing M_tactics and social policy were not M_swiftly introduced ( Hansard , vol. 20 , 25 March 1982 : cols. 1107‰ÛÒ81 ) ."
as6-fragment02,364,"The need to M_support the police was accepted by both the Labour and the Conservative speakers M_in the parliamentary debate M_on the riots , and was established as a benchmark for the official M_response M_to the riots M_long M_before the Scarman Report was published M_in November 1981 ."
as6-fragment02,365,Any substantive disagreement M_centred M_around the issue of what M_role social deprivation and unemployment M_had M_in M_bringing young people to protest violently on the streets .
as6-fragment02,366,"Intermingled M_with the discourses M_about race and law and M_order were M_constant references M_to unemployment , particularly M_among the young , and various M_forms of social disadvantage and poverty ( Solomos , 1988 , pp. 186‰ÛÒ911 ) ."
as6-fragment02,367,"M_Throughout 1980 and 1981 debates M_about the riots M_in the media , M_in Parliament , and M_in various official reports M_hinged M_around the interrelationship M_between racial , law-and-order , and social M_factors ."
as6-fragment02,368,"The importance of M_this debate can be explained , partly , by the political M_capital which the Opposition could M_make M_from M_linking the social and economic M_malaise of the country at large M_with violent street disturbances ."
as6-fragment02,369,"Conversely , M_throughout M_this period Government Ministers strenuously denied that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest ."
as6-fragment02,370,"Although the Scarman Report is often M_taken to be the M_central text which M_argues for a M_link M_between ‰Û÷ social conditions ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ M_disorder ‰Ûª , the terms of the debate were by no means M_set by Scarman ."
as6-fragment02,371,During both April and July 1981 M_vigorous M_exchanges M_took M_place M_in the press and M_in Parliament M_about the M_role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have M_played M_in bringing about the riots .
as6-fragment02,372,"During the 16 July parliamentary debate M_on ‰Û÷ Civil Disturbances ‰Ûª , Roy Hattersley 's M_formulation of M_this M_linkage provided a useful summary of the ‰Û÷ social conditions ‰Ûª argument ."
as6-fragment02,373,"M_After some preliminary remarks M_about the Labour party 's M_support for the police , he went on to M_outline his opposition M_to the M_view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts :"
as6-fragment02,374,I repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week 's riots was the conduct of the police .
as6-fragment02,375,"It was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the M_decaying areas of our old cities ‰ÛÓ areas in which the Brixton and Toxteth riots M_took M_place , and areas from which the skinhead M_invaders of Southall come ."
as6-fragment02,376,"( Hansard , vol. 8 , 16 July 1981 : col. 1408 )"
as6-fragment02,377,Much of the subsequent controversy M_about M_this analysis M_centred M_on the question of youth unemployment .
as6-fragment02,378,"Hattersley had suggested that the riots were a ‰Û÷ M_direct M_product ‰Ûª of high M_levels of youth unemployment , and a furious debate ensued M_in both Parliament and the media M_about M_this assertion ."
as6-fragment02,379,"The final symbolic M_cue used to M_make M_sense of the 1980‰ÛÒ1 protests is more difficult to categorize , but its basic meaning can be M_captured by the term ‰Û÷ political marginality ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,380,"While a M_number of discussions of the M_roots of urban unrest in the United States have M_noted the salience of political marginality M_in determining participation M_in violent protests ( Skolnick , 1969 ; Fogelson , 1971 ; Edelman , 1971 ; Knopf , 1975 ) , M_this issue has M_received relatively little attention in Britain ."
as6-fragment02,381,"Nevertheless , during the 1980‰ÛÒ1 events and their aftermath the political M_context was discussed M_from a M_number of M_perspectives ."
as6-fragment02,382,"The Scarman Report , for example , M_located M_part of the explanation for the riots M_in the feelings of alienation and M_powerlessness which were experienced by young blacks living in M_depressed inner-city areas ."
as6-fragment02,383,"A successful policy for M_tackling the M_roots of urban M_disorder was M_seen as one which M_sought to involve all the community M_in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could M_come to M_feel that they M_have a M_stake M_in its future ( Scarman , 1981 , para. 6.42 ) ."
as6-fragment02,384,"M_Where such arguments did not fit in M_with the overarching themes of race , violence and M_disorder , and social deprivation they were either M_sidelined or M_pushed M_into the sub-clauses of official reports ."
as6-fragment02,385,"The Scarman Report , for example , M_contained the following policy proposal : ‰Û÷ I recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved M_in M_planning , M_in the provision of local services , and M_in the management and financing of specific projects , ( Scarman , 1981 , para. 8.44 ) ."
as6-fragment02,386,Such a M_move M_towards M_greater political integration was M_seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the M_gap M_between inner-city residents and the M_forces of law and M_order was to be M_bridged .
as6-fragment02,387,"But the concern M_with M_overcoming political marginality M_remained M_on the M_sidelines of the main public debate because it M_questioned the perception of the rioters as M_driven by irrational , uncivilized , and criminal instincts ."
as6-fragment02,388,"M_This did not , however , M_stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies M_from being M_raised at all , as can be M_seen subsequently by the attempts M_after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally M_measures which were meant to M_address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur ."
as6-fragment02,389,M_Aspects of M_these M_measures are considered M_further M_on M_in the chapter .
as6-fragment02,390,M_PERSPECTIVES M_ON THE 1985 RIOTS
as6-fragment02,391,"Despite widespread predictions of further unrest M_in the aftermath of 1981 , the M_scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators ."
as6-fragment02,392,"Handsworth , for example , was M_presented even shortly M_before September 1985 as a ‰Û÷ success story ‰Ûª in terms of police ‰ÛÓ community relations ."
as6-fragment02,393,The outbreak of violence in M_this area was therefore widely M_presented as an aberration .
as6-fragment02,394,"Similarly the M_spread of violence in London to areas such as the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham was M_seen as a M_break M_from previous experience , which had M_centred M_on areas such as Brixton ."
as6-fragment02,395,There are many M_continuities M_between 1980‰ÛÒ1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense M_images used M_in the press and television to M_cover the events .
as6-fragment02,396,"But M_responses M_in 1985 were different , at least in terms of M_degree , and probably in relation to the M_extent M_to which the riots were M_seen as a ‰Û÷ race ‰Ûª phenomenon by a M_wider M_body of opinion ."
as6-fragment02,397,The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be M_found M_in much of the press coverage during 1980‰ÛÒ1 had at least M_acted as a countervailing tendency M_against the more extreme M_forms of discourse which M_blamed the riots completely M_on black people .
as6-fragment02,398,"During the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath , the M_imagery of ‰Û÷ race ‰Ûª was M_used by M_sections of the press M_without the M_sense of ambiguity which could still be M_found M_in 1980‰ÛÒ1 ."
as6-fragment02,399,"The ‰Û÷ silence M_over race ‰Ûª was M_breached M_in 1980‰ÛÒ1 , but M_in 1985 debate M_about racial issues was M_taken a M_step M_further ."
as6-fragment02,400,"Peregrine Worsthorne , for example , used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth , Brixton , and Tottenham to argue that there was a major M_question M_mark M_over the possibility of assimilating the ‰Û÷ M_coloured population ‰Ûª M_into mainstream ‰Û÷ British values ‰Ûª ( Sunday Telegraph , 29 September 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,401,"To be sure there was still a M_strong M_response opposing Enoch Powell 's M_call for repatriation , M_from all M_shades of political opinion , but the racialization of public debate M_about the 1985 riots M_went much M_further than 1980‰ÛÒ1 ."
as6-fragment02,402,M_In this M_context it was the M_externality of British Afro-Caribbeans and Asians which was M_highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which M_worked M_against blacks M_at all M_levels of society .
as6-fragment02,403,"The usage of ‰Û÷ race ‰Ûª during the September-October 1985 period M_took M_on new meanings , which M_had little if anything to M_do M_with the M_impact of racism as such , since the M_emphasis was M_on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves ."
as6-fragment02,404,"M_After Handsworth M_part of the press M_response was to blame the riot M_on rivalry M_between West Indians and Asians , and even M_after the arguments were criticized by local residents ; and community leaders , they were used to ‰Û÷ explain ‰Ûª ' what happened ."
as6-fragment02,405,"In addition , the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities , their family M_structures , and their political M_attitudes ‰Û÷ M_bred violence ‰Ûª was constantly M_raised ( van Dijk , 1988 ) ."
as6-fragment02,406,"The actual facts ' of who was arrested during the riots , whether black or white , were hardly debated since it was M_assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved M_with crime ( Keith , 1987 ) ."
as6-fragment02,407,"The M_imagery of the ‰Û÷ black bomber , used M_in Handsworth was M_extended M_to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who M_saw the riots as a chance to M_engage M_in an ‰Û÷ M_orgy of looting ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,408,The Dear Report M_on Handsworth M_captures M_this M_image and M_links it M_to the social condition of young blacks :
as6-fragment02,409,"The majority of rioters who M_took part M_in M_these M_unhappy events were young , black and Afro-Caribbean M_origin ."
as6-fragment02,410,"M_Let there be no doubt , M_these young criminals are not M_in any M_way representative of the M_vast majority of the Afro-Caribbean community whose life has M_contributed M_to the life and culture of the West Midlands M_over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are M_at M_one M_with M_those of every other law-abiding citizen ."
as6-fragment02,411,We M_share a common M_sorrow .
as6-fragment02,412,It is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not M_tainted by the actions of a criminal minority .
as6-fragment02,413,"( Dear , 1985 , p. 69 )"
as6-fragment02,414,"M_This ‰Û÷ black ‰Ûª criminal minority was M_constructed not only M_into the leading M_force behind the riots , but sometimes as the only force ."
as6-fragment02,415,"Indeed , M_throughout September and October 1985 , and during the following months , the M_imagery of race M_continued to M_dominate debate M_about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots ."
as6-fragment02,416,"As M_pointed M_out earlier , the ‰Û÷ social causes ‰Ûª argument was another major M_plank of public debate M_about the 1980‰ÛÒ1 riots , particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment ."
as6-fragment02,417,"During 1985 M_this issue was M_raised once again , though M_by then the M_extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and M_decay was more M_stark than it had been M_in 198l ."
as6-fragment02,418,"M_Images of ‰Û÷ urban M_decay ‰Ûª , ‰Û÷ M_tinderbox cities ‰Ûª , and ‰Û÷ M_ghetto streets ‰Ûª M_linked M_up M_with the M_images of ‰Û÷ race inequality ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ M_black M_ghettos ‰Ûª to M_produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory ."
as6-fragment02,419,An interesting M_mixture of the various M_images was provided by a story M_in the Daily Telegraph M_under the headline : ‰Û÷ Broadwater Farm : Like the M_Divis M_Flats M_with M_Reggae ‰Ûª ( 8 October 1985 ) .
as6-fragment02,420,"The Mirror M_described the estate as ‰Û÷ M_Living M_Hell ‰Ûª , and M_quoted one resident as saying that ‰Û÷ You 'M_ve no idea how awful daily life is ‰Ûª ( 8 October 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,421,"Such M_images were reworkings of arguments already used M_about Toxteth M_in 1981 and Brixton M_in 1981 , but they were used more widely than M_in 1980‰ÛÒ1 ."
as6-fragment02,422,"Even the Daily Mail , which M_deployed the M_clearest M_use of ‰Û÷ race ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ M_outside agitator ‰Ûª arguments , M_ran a major story M_on Broadwater Farm M_under the headline : ‰Û÷ M_Burnt-out M_hulks M_litter this concrete M_jungle ‰Û_ despair M_hangs M_heavy ‰Ûª ( 8 October 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,423,"A M_number of stories using such M_imagery were M_run by both the quality and the popular press during M_this period , but similar arguments are to be M_found M_in parliamentary debates ( Hansard , vol. 84 , 21 October 1985 , cols. 30-.46 , 388 ) , and even M_in official reports produced by the police M_on the riots in Birmingham and London ."
as6-fragment02,424,"The ‰Û÷ cities of M_inner despair ‰Ûª were M_conceived as the M_breeding M_ground for M_disorderly protest , and however M_hard the Government tried to M_break the causal M_link M_between the M_two , it was M_forced to M_take M_on M_board the need to M_restore M_order not only M_through the police but M_through promises of help for the inner cities ."
as6-fragment02,425,"Much as M_in 1980‰ÛÒ1 , the ‰Û÷ social causes ‰Ûª argument can not be M_seen M_separately M_from the M_broader debate M_about the future of the British economy and society ."
as6-fragment02,426,"The Government 's record M_on unemployment was a M_heavily politicized issue , and just as M_in 1981 it vehemently M_denied any responsibility for the riots M_through its M_pursuit of M_free-market policies ."
as6-fragment02,427,But the Government did M_find a M_way of accepting a M_link M_between the riots and social problems M_without M_bringing its main policies M_into the debate : namely by M_linking the M_growth of violent M_disorder M_to crime and drugs .
as6-fragment02,428,The M_emphasis M_on ‰Û÷ crime ‰Ûª and the ‰Û÷ criminal M_acts ‰Ûª of the rioters M_in the official M_responses M_to the 1985 riots M_took a general and a specific M_form .
as6-fragment02,429,"The general M_form M_relied M_on the argument that the riots were not a M_form of protest M_against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police , but a ‰Û÷ criminal M_act ‰Ûª or a ‰Û÷ M_cry for M_loot ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,430,"M_This was an argument M_put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear , Chief Constable of the West Midlands ( Dear , 1985 ) and by Douglas Hurd , the Home Secretary , in relation to Handsworth ."
as6-fragment02,431,But it recurred as a theme M_in official and press M_responses M_to the other riots .
as6-fragment02,432,"The specific M_form was M_built M_upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton , in particular , was brought about by ‰Û÷ drug barons ‰Ûª who M_saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control ‰Û÷ their territory ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,433,"Numerous examples of M_this M_line of argument can be M_found M_in Dear 's report M_on Handsworth , and M_in press coverage during the riots ."
as6-fragment02,434,"M_Taking the specific argument M_about the M_role of drugs and ‰Û÷ drug barons ‰Ûª M_in stimulating the riots , M_this seems to have M_served two purposes ."
as6-fragment02,435,"First , it M_distanced the riots M_from the social , economic , political , and other M_grievances which had been M_linked M_to them by M_locating the cause M_outside the ‰Û÷ social problems ‰Ûª of inner-city dwellers and M_in the ‰Û÷ simple greed ‰Ûª of the drug M_barons to accumulate ‰Û÷ M_loot ‰Ûª ."
as6-fragment02,436,"Second , just as Dear 's M_image of a few hundred ‰Û÷ young black criminals ‰Ûª was used to explain what happened in Handsworth , the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened M_at a national M_level ."
as6-fragment02,437,"The issue of drugs provided an everyday M_image , already a national issue M_through M_saturation media coverage and public debate , M_around which the police , the Home Office , and other institutions could M_depoliticize the riots ."
as6-fragment02,438,"Responding M_to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was M_moved to argue M_forcibly that such events were M_senseless and M_reflected more M_on those who participated M_in them than M_on the society M_in which they M_took M_place : ‰Û÷ The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard M_on Monday night , the M_echoes of which I M_picked M_up M_on Tuesday , was not a M_cry for help but a M_cry for M_loot ‰Ûª ( Financial Times , 13 September 1985 ) ."
as6-fragment02,439,"The Chief Constable for the West Midlands , Geoffrey Dear , M_took M_this argument M_further by M_pointing M_out that the day M_before the riots a successful carnival had M_taken M_place , M_with the M_support of local community leaders ."
as6-fragment02,440,"He M_drew the conclusion M_from M_this that the riot ‰Û÷ M_came like a M_bolt M_out M_of the M_blue ‰Ûª ( Guardian , 21 November 1985 ) ."

b1g-fragment02,739,Overview
b1g-fragment02,740,Ian Masser
b1g-fragment02,741,"Given the M_extent M_to which geographic information management is M_applications driven , it is important to M_consider M_in some M_depth the characteristics of some potential M_application M_fields ."
b1g-fragment02,742,M_In the process it will be necessary to M_examine not only the M_extent M_to which geographic issues feature M_on the policy issues agenda M_in M_these M_fields but also the institutional M_context which M_governs decision-making and the M_extent M_to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes .
b1g-fragment02,743,M_Questions M_on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are M_heavily dependent M_on secondary M_sources .
b1g-fragment02,744,M_In M_situations of M_this kind M_provisions M_governing M_access and M_format may M_exert M_powerful constraints M_on the use that can be M_made of M_these data .
b1g-fragment02,745,The first four chapters M_in M_this M_part M_examine issues relating M_to geographic information M_handling in terms of four potential M_applications M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,746,The authors were asked to review the current M_state of the M_art M_in their M_fields M_with particular reference M_to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they M_make M_on geographic information management .
b1g-fragment02,747,Authors were also asked to evaluate critically the M_state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to M_consider the M_impact of user requirements M_on the development of geographic information M_handling methodology .
b1g-fragment02,748,M_In M_this M_way the chapters M_in M_this M_part M_present a number of M_perspectives which essentially complement and M_amplify the M_discussion M_in the previous M_part .
b1g-fragment02,749,"M_In M_this case , however , methodological issues are M_tackled M_from a largely user standpoint , whereas M_in the previous M_part they were M_viewed as substantive problems M_in their own right ."
b1g-fragment02,750,M_In effect the M_product of the M_discussion M_in both M_parts is a M_matrix where the methodological issues are M_listed M_along one M_axis and particular M_applications M_fields M_on the M_other .
b1g-fragment02,751,Figure 8.1 M_summarizes the main M_features of M_this matrix .
b1g-fragment02,752,There are important differences M_between the chapters M_in M_this M_part both M_in the M_nature of the demands that they M_make M_on geographic information and also M_in the relative importance that is M_attached M_to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers M_in M_these M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,753,"The first three chapters M_dealing M_with environmental monitoring , natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure M_applications M_make use of a very M_wide M_range of geographic information ."
b1g-fragment02,754,A major M_feature of M_these M_applications is the M_extent M_to which they involve M_overlays of a variety of information M_drawn M_from different M_sources M_on a topographic map M_base .
b1g-fragment02,755,for M_this reason they M_make particularly M_heavy demands M_on current GIS technology both because of the M_size of the data sets and the diversity of the data M_structures that are involved .
b1g-fragment02,756,Brown 's chapter M_on geodemographics M_discusses an M_application M_field M_where primary data M_collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data M_derived M_from M_sources such as the Census of Population .
b1g-fragment02,757,The M_range of data sets involved and the demands that are M_made M_on GIS technology M_in M_applications of M_this kind are often more limited than M_those of previous M_applications M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,758,"However , M_this is offset by the demands that are M_made M_on spatial analysis and M_modelling methodology ."
b1g-fragment02,759,Rhind 's chapter M_on environmental monitoring and prediction M_discusses the M_role of geographic information management M_in promoting sustainable development M_on a global M_scale M_in the M_context of the issues M_identified M_in the Brundtland report .
b1g-fragment02,760,It M_points M_to the M_impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to M_have M_on most M_sectors of the UK economy .
b1g-fragment02,761,M_This M_contribution also M_indicates the M_wide variety of groups that are involved M_in monitoring environmental M_change and M_draws attention M_to the M_role that the European Community is increasingly M_playing M_in M_co-ordinating M_these efforts .
b1g-fragment02,762,One of the examples of work M_in M_progress M_discusses research that has been carried out for the European Commission as M_part of the CORINE Project .
b1g-fragment02,763,"M_This M_highlights the M_challenges for research M_in a M_field categorized by a lack of data for some countries , varying definitions and M_standards M_in use , and unreasonably M_high user expectations ."
b1g-fragment02,764,The chapter as a whole M_draws attention M_to a number of key methodological issues that are involved M_in environmental monitoring and prediction .
b1g-fragment02,765,"M_These M_include the highly specialized M_nature of much of the technical analysis , the limited M_capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of M_this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of M_knowledge-based inference machines for M_extracting useful information M_from secondary and often proxy data ."
b1g-fragment02,766,"In Chapter 10 Gatrell and Vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards , risk assessment , hazardous waste disposal , emergency planning , natural hazards and environmental epidemiology ."
b1g-fragment02,767,"The substantive content of much of this research straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences ."
b1g-fragment02,768,"To model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area , for example , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution would be required ."
b1g-fragment02,769,In applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and GIS in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field .
b1g-fragment02,770,"The discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters , particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets ."
b1g-fragment02,771,"Like most of the other contributors to this section , Gatrell and Vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field ."
b1g-fragment02,772,"Given that ‰Û÷ most GIS are rather dumb systems , requiring intelligent , very computer literate users ‰Ûª , managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency ."
b1g-fragment02,773,The settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests .
b1g-fragment02,774,These include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers .
b1g-fragment02,775,"According to Shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount , capacity and condition of urban land , transport networks , utilities , hospitals , schools and other major communal facilities ."
b1g-fragment02,776,"In addition to these data requirements , such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making ."
b1g-fragment02,777,"Shepherd , more than any other contributor to this section , draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms , the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision , data ownership and the control of access to data ."
b1g-fragment02,778,Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision .
b1g-fragment02,779,In Chapter 12 Brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of US census tract data from 1950 onwards .
b1g-fragment02,780,"He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location , market research , credit rating and target marketing ."
b1g-fragment02,781,Brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live .
b1g-fragment02,782,"In the last part of this contribution , Brown identifies a number of priorities for future research ."
b1g-fragment02,783,"Like Gatrell and Vincent and Shepherd before him , he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses ."
b1g-fragment02,784,Spatial linkages also feature prominently in Brown 's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from Openshaw in Chapter 3 .
b1g-fragment02,785,The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors .
b1g-fragment02,786,Other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice .
b1g-fragment02,787,This is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature .
b1g-fragment02,788,"In summary , then , as fig. 8.1 shows , many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments ."
b1g-fragment02,789,Spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics .
b1g-fragment02,790,Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications .
b1g-fragment02,791,Spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields .
b1g-fragment02,792,The evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields .
b1g-fragment02,793,"Finally , in all applications fields , the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds ."
b1g-fragment02,794,This is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities .
b1g-fragment02,795,Such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers .
b1g-fragment02,796,The final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information .
b1g-fragment02,797,Campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of GIS .
b1g-fragment02,798,This contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice .
b1g-fragment02,799,"All too often , as the experience of many mature applications indicates , technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities ."
b1g-fragment02,800,Campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of GIS diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines .
b1g-fragment02,801,The findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields .
b1g-fragment02,802,In this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by Openshaw at the beginning of Part Two .
b1g-fragment02,803,Environmental monitoring and prediction
b1g-fragment02,804,David Rhind
b1g-fragment02,805,Introduction
b1g-fragment02,806,"Monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind ( Tickell 1986 , 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,807,"This awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion , on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming , on nitrate pollution , on deforestation in the Tropics , on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics ."
b1g-fragment02,808,Usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming Armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation .
b1g-fragment02,809,Thus the algal bloom off the Italian Adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds .
b1g-fragment02,810,"More globally , the Brundtland Report ( WCED 1987 ) noted that , in the 900 days during which the World Commission was at work ,"
b1g-fragment02,811,1 .
b1g-fragment02,812,The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them ;
b1g-fragment02,813,2 .
b1g-fragment02,814,The Bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more ;
b1g-fragment02,815,3 .
b1g-fragment02,816,The Chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across Europe ;
b1g-fragment02,817,4 .
b1g-fragment02,818,A chemical fire in Switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the Rhine at least as far as the Netherlands ;
b1g-fragment02,819,5 .
b1g-fragment02,820,At least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water .
b1g-fragment02,821,"As a consequence of these and other disasters , of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals , the environment is now ‰Û÷ moving fast up the political agenda ‰Ûª ( Patten 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,822,"The then Prime Minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as : ‰Û÷ it is possible that with all these enormous changes ( population , agricultural , use of fossil fuels ) concentrated into such a short period of time , we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself ‰Ûª ( Thatcher 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,823,The political concern is not altruistic .
b1g-fragment02,824,"Mrs Thatcher , a recent convert to environmental conservation , clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :"
b1g-fragment02,825,"In the past when we identified forms of pollution , we have shown our capacity to act effectively ."
b1g-fragment02,826,The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past .
b1g-fragment02,827,We have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent .
b1g-fragment02,828,"We are spending å£4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone , and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world ."
b1g-fragment02,829,"Even though this kind of action may cost a lot , I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other ‰Û_ ."
b1g-fragment02,830,The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development .
b1g-fragment02,831,Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded ( Thatcher 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,832,The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government 's White Paper ( HMSO 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,833,"While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‰Û÷ teeth ‰Ûª and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments ( notably those of Agriculture and of Transport ) , it was none the less a major achievement ."
b1g-fragment02,834,"Its main sections dealt with the government 's approach to the environment ( nationally , at the European level and globally ) , the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect , environmental problems in both rural and urban areas ( especially in relation to land-use matters ) , pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters ."
b1g-fragment02,835,Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence .
b1g-fragment02,836,There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment .
b1g-fragment02,837,"Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper , the environmental cause seems as strong as ever ."
b1g-fragment02,838,"Thus , The Times of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ‰Û÷ ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change ‰Ûª ."
b1g-fragment02,839,"Pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have argued that the effects of government , commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the UK government will proceed ."
b1g-fragment02,840,"Given such a lead , it is scarcely surprising that British scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes ; Table 9.1 , for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the UK domestic economy ."
b1g-fragment02,841,"If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary , indeed is even vital , the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important : the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level !"
b1g-fragment02,842,"Yet , as we shall see below , the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that , in many cases , we simply do not yet have ."
b1g-fragment02,843,"Even monitoring of the present is very imperfect , as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates ."
b1g-fragment02,844,"This chapter , then , attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction , describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next ."
b1g-fragment02,845,The nature of environmental processes
b1g-fragment02,846,"Notwithstanding Mrs Thatcher 's confidence that we can ‰Û÷ fix ‰Ûª environmental problems , the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable ."
b1g-fragment02,847,"Some of the reasons for this ‰ÛÓ the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks , taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes , processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and ( often ) multinational researchers involved ‰ÛÓ are discussed briefly later ."
b1g-fragment02,848,"Even at this stage , however , it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment ."
b1g-fragment02,849,The next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know ; it is derived chiefly from the Earth System Sciences Committee ( ESSC ) ( 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,850,Temporal and spatial scales of operation
b1g-fragment02,851,"Even ignoring the effects of man , earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales ( see Fig. 9.1 ; see also Rosswall et al. 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,852,"Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations ( such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles ) , are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle ."
b1g-fragment02,853,"In contrast , soil creation ( cf. soil degradation ) may require hundreds or thousands of years ."
b1g-fragment02,854,In between are variations in phenomena such as El Nino .
b1g-fragment02,855,The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement .
b1g-fragment02,856,"In this chapter , the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km ."
b1g-fragment02,857,"It is , however , impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods : a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades ."
b1g-fragment02,858,"Conversely , a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects ."
b1g-fragment02,859,This therefore has the following consequences :
b1g-fragment02,860,1 .
b1g-fragment02,861,We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends ;
b1g-fragment02,862,2 .
b1g-fragment02,863,"Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings , we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge ( such as via tree rings , palynology , oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change ) ;"
b1g-fragment02,864,3 .
b1g-fragment02,865,"Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems , collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise ;"
b1g-fragment02,866,4 .
b1g-fragment02,867,We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced ;
b1g-fragment02,868,5 .
b1g-fragment02,869,"Irrespective of the use of surrogates , monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards ( hence the IGBP ( see below ) is designed to run for two or three decades ) ;"
b1g-fragment02,870,6 .
b1g-fragment02,871,Changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available .
b1g-fragment02,872,Much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis .
b1g-fragment02,873,This is not merely because of its topical nature .
b1g-fragment02,874,The main reason is that ‰ÛÓ though some problems are local and are best studied that way ‰ÛÓ many others ( even involving a limited geographical extent ) are best understood within a global framework .
b1g-fragment02,875,Thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world .
b1g-fragment02,876,"Moreover , recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic ( every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather ) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic ."
b1g-fragment02,877,"Thus , to understand some local and many regional , national and continental and all global environmental events , we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases ( Rhind and Mounsey 1989 ; Mounsey and Tomlinson 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,878,"In no way , however , does this invalidate the need for microscale studies ‰ÛÓ for instance , while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them , only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring ."
b1g-fragment02,879,The processes themselves
b1g-fragment02,880,"A major complication , however , is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment ."
b1g-fragment02,881,"Given this , determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty ."
b1g-fragment02,882,"Figure 9.2 is taken from ESSC ( 1988 ) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes , as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment ."
b1g-fragment02,883,"In essence , the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one , these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities ."
b1g-fragment02,884,The main components of the first system are well known : the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions .
b1g-fragment02,885,"We are , however , becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate ; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority ."
b1g-fragment02,886,"In ocean dynamics studies , important topics are heat storage , circulation and the role of sea ice ."
b1g-fragment02,887,"Atmospheric circulation ( and , in turn , precipitation and temperature ) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface , itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics ."
b1g-fragment02,888,"The biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life ‰ÛÓ carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and others ‰ÛÓ through what has been described as the total earth system ."
b1g-fragment02,889,The oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles ; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget .
b1g-fragment02,890,"Trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulphur and the halogens ; as is now well known , their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide , ozone , methane , nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes ( CFMs ) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system ."
b1g-fragment02,891,"A particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main CFMs is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane , nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per cent ."
b1g-fragment02,892,"Finally , the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone ."
b1g-fragment02,893,There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability ( except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost ) .
b1g-fragment02,894,"If , for instance , the concentrations of certain trace gases ( see above ) continue to increase , it has been predicted that the earth 's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation ( about 18 000 years BP ) ‰ÛÓ though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change ."
b1g-fragment02,895,"The converse case ‰ÛÓ the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes ‰ÛÓ is also of obvious importance : changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation , together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts , are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type , at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity ."
b1g-fragment02,896,Human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology .
b1g-fragment02,897,"fossil fuel combustion , for instance , has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation ( ‰Ûª acid rain' ) and many rivers , lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural , urban or industrial sources ."
b1g-fragment02,898,"It should be stressed , however , that ‰ÛÓ while the outlines of human activities are clear ‰ÛÓ there are still many uncertainties : for instance , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959 ."
b1g-fragment02,899,"But calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that , if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere , the concentration would have increased by twice as much ."
b1g-fragment02,900,"The absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors : absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota , the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the Industrial Revolution ."
b1g-fragment02,901,Does God play dice ?
b1g-fragment02,902,Much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or Newtonian deterministic basis .
b1g-fragment02,903,"The environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered , described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known ."
b1g-fragment02,904,"An argument by many atmospheric physicists , for example , is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models , the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power ( see Fig. 9.3 , derived from Tyler 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,905,"In contrast , the advocates of chaos theory ( e.g. Stewart 1989 ) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even ‰Û÷ the faint beat of a butterfly 's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane ‰Ûª ."
b1g-fragment02,906,"In essence , they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework ."
b1g-fragment02,907,"If so , there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems ."
b1g-fragment02,908,"This has been recognized by , among others , ESSC ( 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,909,The authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2‰ÛÒ3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics ; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic .
b1g-fragment02,910,"To complicate matters still further , however , it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components ."
b1g-fragment02,911,"As an example , atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability , a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations , a weak minimum variability for 10‰ÛÒ20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales ( ESSC 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,912,It need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise .
b1g-fragment02,913,"Finally , it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed ."
b1g-fragment02,914,"In general , the research work of the international groups of scientists , including those involved in the Inter-Governmental Committee and in the UK 's Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change , has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of , for example , global warming ."
b1g-fragment02,915,"In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution , Sir John Mason ( a former Director of the Meteorological Office ) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises ; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans , etc. , lower values of predicted changes are likely ."
b1g-fragment02,916,"Thus , while almost all scientists are ‰ÛÓ at the time of writing ‰ÛÓ convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average , the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago ."
b1g-fragment02,917,Who is involved and what is going on ?
b1g-fragment02,918,"If we consider the environment in the broadest sense , much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the UK ; these include the DoE , the Forestry Commission , the Nature Conservancy , the Health and Safety Executive , local authorities , the component members of the Natural Environment Research Council ( such as the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the British Antarctic Survey ) , individuals or research groups in academia , the CEGB , the Friends of the Earth , and UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development ( CEED ) ( 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,919,"The diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries ; numerous multinational organizations , both quasi-governmental ( e.g. the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) ) and non-governmental ( e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and the International Institute for Environment and Development ( IIED ) ) are also active in the field ."
b1g-fragment02,920,"Moreover , commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine , notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures ."
b1g-fragment02,921,The international scientific involvement
b1g-fragment02,922,Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment .
b1g-fragment02,923,"Thus , at the global scale , the International Council of Scientific Unions ( ICSU ) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project ( IGBP ) to ‰Û÷ describe and understand the interactive physical , chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system , the unique environment it provides for life , the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions ‰Ûª ( Report of ad hoc Planning Group for IGBP 1986 , quoted in IGBP 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,924,"Priority in the IGBP is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries , that most affect the biosphere , that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical , predictive capability for global change ."
b1g-fragment02,925,This is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes :
b1g-fragment02,926,1 .
b1g-fragment02,927,Documenting and predicting global change ;
b1g-fragment02,928,2 .
b1g-fragment02,929,Observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions ;
b1g-fragment02,930,3 .
b1g-fragment02,931,Improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total Earth system ;
b1g-fragment02,932,4 .
b1g-fragment02,933,Assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources .
b1g-fragment02,934,"By 1990 , IGBP had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects ( IGBP 1990 ) addressing these four themes ."
b1g-fragment02,935,"In addition , plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for IGBP ( known as IGBP-DIS ) had been announced ."
b1g-fragment02,936,The latter are particularly relevant to this chapter .
b1g-fragment02,937,"Based in Paris and working under Professor I. Rasool , it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years ( 1990‰ÛÒ92 ) but then to expand considerably thereafter ."
b1g-fragment02,938,"Tasks agreed for the IGBP-DIS include making available a ‰Û÷ directory of data directories ‰Ûª modelled on NASA 's Master Directory , providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study ."
b1g-fragment02,939,"Until 1990 , remarkably little interaction had taken place between the ‰Û÷ hard science ‰Ûª and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,940,"It is noteworthy , however , that the Royal Society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the House of Lords ' Select Committee on Science and Technology ( Royal Society 1989 : 40 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,941,"Fortunately , in addition to the actions of the world ‰Û÷ hard science ‰Ûª community , a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists ( Fuchs 1989 ; Jacobson and Price 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,942,"Currently this is organized and sponsored by the International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) , the UN University and the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies ."
b1g-fragment02,943,Its objectives are to :
b1g-fragment02,944,1 .
b1g-fragment02,945,Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system ;
b1g-fragment02,946,2 .
b1g-fragment02,947,"Study , explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment ;"
b1g-fragment02,948,3 .
b1g-fragment02,949,Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable ;
b1g-fragment02,950,4 .
b1g-fragment02,951,Analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development .
b1g-fragment02,952,"Jacobson and Price ( 1990 ) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to , and are affected by , likely global changes ; in particular , they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation ."
b1g-fragment02,953,The ISSC proposed its own work programme in the Human Dimensions of Global Change in late 1990 .
b1g-fragment02,954,"While these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change , others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base ."
b1g-fragment02,955,A leading example of this is the European Science Foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change ( ESF 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,956,Governmental and political involvement
b1g-fragment02,957,"The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas , a decade later the number was 144 ( WEC 1985 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,958,"In most countries , the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people : the early development of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany is something of an exception ."
b1g-fragment02,959,"Such a commitment to the environment is , none the less , both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing , let alone forthcoming , environmental problems ."
b1g-fragment02,960,The ‰Û÷ conversion ‰Ûª of the UK government has been briefly described earlier ; it is manifested in their July 1989 commitment to spend å£10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the Advisory Board for the Research Councils ( ABRC ) for an extra å£11m. in 1990 and å£13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research .
b1g-fragment02,961,"Perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is the increasing role of the European Commission ."
b1g-fragment02,962,"Their role in bringing environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) on to the statute book is well known , but the Commission has now made a proposal ( CEC 1989 ) for the ‰Û÷ establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Monitoring and Information Network ‰Ûª ."
b1g-fragment02,963,"The Commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale , nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis ( a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later ) ."
b1g-fragment02,964,"The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes ; it must also , however , be seen in the context of the European Council 's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992 ."
b1g-fragment02,965,The detailed specific roles of ‰Û÷ the System ‰Ûª ( comprising both agency and network ) are envisaged as :
b1g-fragment02,966,1 .
b1g-fragment02,967,"To provide the Community , the Member States and participating third countries with the objective ( sic ) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies ;"
b1g-fragment02,968,2 .
b1g-fragment02,969,"In particular , to provide technical , scientific and economic information requested by the Commission in its tasks of identification , preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation ;"
b1g-fragment02,970,3 .
b1g-fragment02,971,To stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time ;
b1g-fragment02,972,4 .
b1g-fragment02,973,"To help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the Community as well as the integration of European environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes , such as those established within the framework of the United Nations and its system of agencies ."
b1g-fragment02,974,Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the Community 's borders .
b1g-fragment02,975,It is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it .
b1g-fragment02,976,"Priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality , water resources and quality ( including the marine environment ) , soil erosion and pollution and important land resources , and biotopes and nature conservation ."
b1g-fragment02,977,"At the time of writing , the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency 's headquarters ."
b1g-fragment02,978,It seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in Europe and on the policies of component governments .
b1g-fragment02,979,"Yet this is by no means the only plan which the Community has in relation to the environment : Directorate-General XII ( that for Science , Research and Development ) has published details of an extensive R&D programme ( CEC 1990a ) and the Commission as a whole ( CEC 1990b ) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment ."
b1g-fragment02,980,The private sector
b1g-fragment02,981,"Certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector , notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis ."
b1g-fragment02,982,"Derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution , predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value ."
b1g-fragment02,983,"However , significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus IBM UK Ltd has donated å£3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM in general is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate ‰Û÷ sustainable development ‰Ûª : IBM Europe , for instance , has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company 's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development ."
b1g-fragment02,984,"On a more modest basis , IBM UK have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in Birkbeck College to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population ."
b1g-fragment02,985,"Many other companies , of course , are supporting environmental work but IBM seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating ‰Û÷ sustainable development ‰Ûª ."
b1g-fragment02,986,Some examples of environmental monitoring projects
b1g-fragment02,987,The local scale
b1g-fragment02,988,"At the local scale , it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating ."
b1g-fragment02,989,An example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller ( 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,990,"Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere ( MAB ) project , carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria ."
b1g-fragment02,991,"Following Holling ( 1978 ) and Grossman ( 1983 ) , they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels :"
b1g-fragment02,992,1 .
b1g-fragment02,993,"The lowest , or process , level , is directly and ( usually ) obviously connected to perceived reality ."
b1g-fragment02,994,"Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious , simple and linear ; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous ."
b1g-fragment02,995,"This level is readily handled in commercial GIS ; ,"
b1g-fragment02,996,2 .
b1g-fragment02,997,"The intermediate , or dynamic , level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events , e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire , frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace ."
b1g-fragment02,998,"Characteristically , the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated ; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential ;"
b1g-fragment02,999,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1000,"The top , or strategic , level is the most difficult to explore ; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means ."
b1g-fragment02,1001,Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available .
b1g-fragment02,1002,The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‰Û÷ soft-couple ‰Ûª these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model .
b1g-fragment02,1003,Results of running this with different scenarios include ‰Û÷ time slice ‰Ûª maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area .
b1g-fragment02,1004,"While ultimately qualitative , it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events ."
b1g-fragment02,1005,The national and continental scale : the CORINE project
b1g-fragment02,1006,The CORINE programme represents the product of much activity by the European Commission 's Directorate-General ( XI ) for the Environment .
b1g-fragment02,1007,"It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally ‰Û÷ balanced ‰Ûª and ‰Û÷ unbalanced ‰Ûª areas in the Community ; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and , though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one , funding for this was not secured until 1985 ."
b1g-fragment02,1008,"A 4-year experimental programme to ‰Û÷ collect , co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities ‰Ûª was set up and labelled CORINE ."
b1g-fragment02,1009,"The objectives of CORINE were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states , developing methods for holding , analysing and presenting the data , and encouraging the exchange of data ."
b1g-fragment02,1010,"A number of priority areas were identified , including biotopes of importance for nature conservation , acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the Mediterranean region ( Briggs and Martin 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1011,Many achievements can be claimed by the CORINE project team .
b1g-fragment02,1012,"As a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the Member States ( and often several groups within each one ) , databases of topography , soils , water resources and quality , biotopes , atmospheric emissions , climate , soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the M_whole Community and can be interrelated ; other data sets ( such as land cover , derived from satellite imagery ) have already been compiled for some of the Member States ."
b1g-fragment02,1013,"Various aspects of the CORINE project have been described in papers by Rhind et al. ( 1986 ) , Wiggins et al. ( 1987 ) , Briggs and Martin ( 1988 ) , Briggs and Mounsey ( 1989 ) and CEC ( 1990c ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1014,"For the present purposes , however , the key findings are :"
b1g-fragment02,1015,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1016,"Many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies , confidentiality constraints , cost or non-collection in certain countries ;"
b1g-fragment02,1017,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1018,"The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables , e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and ‰Û÷ maximum temperature ‰Ûª at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways ;"
b1g-fragment02,1019,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1020,The compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases ( see Rhind and Clark 1988 ) is often difficult ;
b1g-fragment02,1021,4 .
b1g-fragment02,1022,User expectations are often unreasonably high ; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions .
b1g-fragment02,1023,"The ‰Û÷ fuzzy ‰Ûª nature of much geographically distributed data , the inherent errors in it , the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future ;"
b1g-fragment02,1024,5 .
b1g-fragment02,1025,More detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of CORINE grows .
b1g-fragment02,1026,The European Commission 's proposal for an environment agency ( see above ) will subsume the CORINE team and databases .
b1g-fragment02,1027,The global scale : NASA and GEMS/GRID
b1g-fragment02,1028,"Without question , the largest ‰Û÷ player ‰Ûª in the global environment arena is NASA ."
b1g-fragment02,1029,"The organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion ‰ÛÓ the IGBP , for instance , has been strongly influenced by NASA proposals ."
b1g-fragment02,1030,A summary of current activities and future plans is given in NASA ( 1988b ) .
b1g-fragment02,1031,"By way of example , current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone , on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth 's radiation budget ."
b1g-fragment02,1032,"Approved future programmes include the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite , the NASA Scatterometer and the joint NASA/CNES Ocean Topography Experiment ."
b1g-fragment02,1033,"In addition , however , funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme ‰ÛÓ the Earth Observing System ( EOS ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1034,This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC ( see above ) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP .
b1g-fragment02,1035,"It will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms , one European Space Agency platform , a Japanese one and also from the manned space station ."
b1g-fragment02,1036,"On this basis , a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day is anticipated by the mid-1990s ."
b1g-fragment02,1037,A major user of NASA data and skills has been the UN Environment Programme .
b1g-fragment02,1038,"formed in the wake of the 1972 Stockholm conference , UNEP soon spawned the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical , scientific and management information on the environment ."
b1g-fragment02,1039,The need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the Global Resources Information Database ( GRID ) resulted .
b1g-fragment02,1040,"Mooneyhan ( 1988 ) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase ; GRID is now involved in integrating , storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases , mostly acquired from NASA ."
b1g-fragment02,1041,"In addition to the work being carried out in the UNEP HQ at Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID site in Geneva , a series of GRID regional nodes are now being set up world-wide , each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data ."
b1g-fragment02,1042,The first of these is in Bangkok and another is to be opened in Latin America .
b1g-fragment02,1043,"Moreover , national nodes are also being set up ; the recent IBM gift to GRID ( see above ) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many African countries , together with national and continental data sets ."
b1g-fragment02,1044,Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff .
b1g-fragment02,1045,Technical aspects and problems
b1g-fragment02,1046,It follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data .
b1g-fragment02,1047,These are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction :
b1g-fragment02,1048,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1049,"The use of secondary data , rather than primary data collected by the data analyst ;"
b1g-fragment02,1050,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1051,"The need , at least with data on the terrestrial environment , for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary ( and often proxy ) data ;"
b1g-fragment02,1052,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1053,The data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities ;
b1g-fragment02,1054,4 .
b1g-fragment02,1055,The analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of ‰Û÷ high priests ‰Ûª ;
b1g-fragment02,1056,5 .
b1g-fragment02,1057,"We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results , let alone of predictions ."
b1g-fragment02,1058,Some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail ; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves .
b1g-fragment02,1059,Remote sensing as a data collection process
b1g-fragment02,1060,"As the need for more extensive , high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing , increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable ."
b1g-fragment02,1061,No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states .
b1g-fragment02,1062,"The problem is now recognized , especially in Europe , and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets ( e.g. through the use of standard classifications , such as that for land use produced by the Conference of European Statisticians in 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1063,"At present , however , ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal ."
b1g-fragment02,1064,"Recognizing this , NASA ( 1988a ) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions : 1 km resolution in XY and 10‰ÛÒ100 m resolution in Z on a global basis , 100 m XY resolution and 1‰ÛÒ10 m resolution in Z for regional databases and 10 m XY resolution and 0.1‰ÛÒ1 m in Z for local studies ."
b1g-fragment02,1065,They argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term : the availability of stereometric data from the French SPOT satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial ( XY ) resolution of about 30 m ( Muller 1989 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1066,"For many terrestrial purposes , however , a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information ( in contrast , more direct measurements of sea state , etc. are possible ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1067,"The value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene , the spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used ."
b1g-fragment02,1068,"Thus far , for instance , accuracies of land cover ( let alone what is often needed , i.e. land use ) determined from Landsat and SPOT imagery for the UK have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classifications ( e.g. built/unbuilt land ) have been used ."
b1g-fragment02,1069,"One solution to this is to ‰Û÷ densify ‰Ûª the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional , spectrally based ones ."
b1g-fragment02,1070,"But the ground conditions in some parts of Europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain : some areas of Portugal , for instance , have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping ."
b1g-fragment02,1071,A further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits .
b1g-fragment02,1072,Relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation ( where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else 's money ) .
b1g-fragment02,1073,It may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the British National Space Centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing ; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of Professor Pearce ( see above ) as the adviser to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment .
b1g-fragment02,1074,Other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the French government by Professor Didier ( 1990 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1075,"Finally , since data are often costly to acquire , it follows that summaries of them e.g. The State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) and the Environmental Data Report of the UN EP ( GEMS MARC 1989 ) are of considerable value ."
b1g-fragment02,1076,"Equally , the ‰Û÷ signposting ‰Ûª role now being adopted by UNEP 's GRID project ‰ÛÓ which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 ‰ÛÓ is to be welcomed ."
b1g-fragment02,1077,The data problem and partial solutions
b1g-fragment02,1078,The lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above .
b1g-fragment02,1079,"In the European Community of 12 nation states , for instance , no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use !"
b1g-fragment02,1080,"The need for harmonization is obvious and , in this respect , must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of EUROSTAT in harmonizing the definitions in trade , demographic and other ‰Û÷ social science ‰Ûª statistics ( see CEC 1990b ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1081,An additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago .
b1g-fragment02,1082,"By 1995/96 , they will be very much greater , notably from the EOS programme ."
b1g-fragment02,1083,NASA has announced plans to collect up to 1 terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day .
b1g-fragment02,1084,"Since remote sensing data sets ( especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe ) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate , transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful ( e.g. land cover ) data , the processing power required is going to be formidable ."
b1g-fragment02,1085,"Other , non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics ."
b1g-fragment02,1086,To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage .
b1g-fragment02,1087,"Parenthetically , the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced ."
b1g-fragment02,1088,"It would be technically possible , for instance , to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world , akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population ."
b1g-fragment02,1089,"In practice , legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form ; the cross-tabulations commonly employed ( e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex ) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes ."
b1g-fragment02,1090,"This all presents major problems of data storage , handling ( especially for global data sets ) , display and dissemination ."
b1g-fragment02,1091,"Fortunately , technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades ."
b1g-fragment02,1092,"Indeed , this may grossly under-represent the present situation : the rapid spread of UNIX-based systems seems to facilitate competition and , at the time of writing , performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum ."
b1g-fragment02,1093,"Moreover , the advent of low-cost , high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM , for instance , can hold about 600 megabytes ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; bytes ) , can be reproduced currently for about å£1 and read on a device costing about å£400 ."
b1g-fragment02,1094,"Yet , despite such revolutionary changes in technology , novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets ."
b1g-fragment02,1095,One such solution is Goodchild and Yang 's ( 1989 ) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth .
b1g-fragment02,1096,A particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data .
b1g-fragment02,1097,The literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account ‰ÛÓ but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved .
b1g-fragment02,1098,Goodchild ( 1988 ) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date .
b1g-fragment02,1099,"Finally , relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource , available to a wide community : many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and ‰Û÷ lost ‰Ûª once the urgency of the initial research is over ."
b1g-fragment02,1100,"However , the 1990 report of the Data and Facilities Working Group of the UK Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role ."
b1g-fragment02,1101,It also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance ; this may be more difficult in ‰Û÷ within country ‰Ûª data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost .
b1g-fragment02,1102,Global environmental research and the social sciences
b1g-fragment02,1103,"Thus far , the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,1104,That is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists .
b1g-fragment02,1105,"Yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels , the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists , and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others ."
b1g-fragment02,1106,"For geographers ‰ÛÓ who span the conventional ( and now archaic ) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences ‰ÛÓ all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change , the redistributions in trade , health and wealth which they will bring about and the ‰Û÷ knock on ‰Ûª effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment ."
b1g-fragment02,1107,"For social scientists , then , environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance , especially as ‰Û÷ globalization ‰Ûª of markets and economies proceeds ."
b1g-fragment02,1108,The Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC ) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding .
b1g-fragment02,1109,These reports ( Pearce 1990 ; Turner 1990 ) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change .
b1g-fragment02,1110,"Pearce ( 1990 ) , for instance , presented an economist 's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows :"
b1g-fragment02,1111,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1112,"The theory and practice of international agreements , viewed in a game theory context ;"
b1g-fragment02,1113,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1114,"The theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty ; ,"
b1g-fragment02,1115,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1116,"Cost-benefit frameworks , especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects ;"
b1g-fragment02,1117,4 .
b1g-fragment02,1118,Definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern Europe and the developing countries ;
b1g-fragment02,1119,5 .
b1g-fragment02,1120,Appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases ;
b1g-fragment02,1121,6 .
b1g-fragment02,1122,Assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest ;
b1g-fragment02,1123,7 .
b1g-fragment02,1124,Economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases ;
b1g-fragment02,1125,8 .
b1g-fragment02,1126,The international politics of climate change ;
b1g-fragment02,1127,9 .
b1g-fragment02,1128,National and global energy options given the greenhouse effect ;
b1g-fragment02,1129,10 .
b1g-fragment02,1130,Trade and global change .
b1g-fragment02,1131,Turner ( 1990 ) argued that the priorities are as follows :
b1g-fragment02,1132,1 .
b1g-fragment02,1133,The socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise ;
b1g-fragment02,1134,2 .
b1g-fragment02,1135,Techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects ;
b1g-fragment02,1136,3 .
b1g-fragment02,1137,"An assessment of management tools , institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change ;"
b1g-fragment02,1138,4 .
b1g-fragment02,1139,Studies of agriculture in relation to climate change ;
b1g-fragment02,1140,5 .
b1g-fragment02,1141,Understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact ;
b1g-fragment02,1142,6 .
b1g-fragment02,1143,The interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics .
b1g-fragment02,1144,"There is , then , no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change ."
b1g-fragment02,1145,Some of it is being carried out : in March 1991 ESRC announced a å£6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change .
b1g-fragment02,1146,"However , perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research ."
b1g-fragment02,1147,"In the USA at least , there needs to be an improvement in scientists ' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research ( see Kitsos and Ashe 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1148,"All too often , it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous ( see Table 9.2 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1149,"Fortunately , considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal , political and institutional aspects of global environmental change ( see , for instance , Nitze 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1150,What next ?
b1g-fragment02,1151,The contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the World Ocean Climate Experiment or the World Climate Research Programme .
b1g-fragment02,1152,Nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the UK ( as elsewhere ) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments .
b1g-fragment02,1153,The consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound ‰ÛÓ as the European Commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data ( CEC 1990d ) ‰ÛÓ yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion .
b1g-fragment02,1154,"Despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available , what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
b1g-fragment02,1155,Such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of ‰Û÷ actors ‰Ûª already involved is vast .
b1g-fragment02,1156,"What is clear , however , is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise , that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes ."
b1g-fragment02,1157,"In these circumstances , it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute , as Terney ( 1989 ) has chronicled in regard to IGBP ."
b1g-fragment02,1158,"Moreover , as Newby ( 1990 ) has pointed out , the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy : ‰Û÷ in the past , ‰Û_ the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective ‰Û÷ hard ‰Ûª facts on which to base their soft , value-ridden policies ‰Û_ ."
b1g-fragment02,1159,"But now we find scientists delivering only ‰Û÷ soft ‰Ûª , uncertain ‰Û÷ facts ‰Ûª to decision-makers facing ‰Û÷ hard ‰Ûª decisions . ‰Ûª"
b1g-fragment02,1160,"Yet , even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists , it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations ."
b1g-fragment02,1161,We shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments ‰ÛÓ certainly in the European Community ‰ÛÓ to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form ( CEC 1990b ) .
b1g-fragment02,1162,"More than that , it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies ."
b1g-fragment02,1163,"Perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring , modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines ."
b1g-fragment02,1164,Building such research teams is essential .
b1g-fragment02,1165,"Underlying it all , however , is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth ."

b1g-fragment02,1169,Managing natural and technological hazards
b1g-fragment02,1170,Anthony C. Gatrell and Peter Vincent
b1g-fragment02,1171,Introduction
b1g-fragment02,1172,"Few areas of the application of GIS technology can be as socially significant , or environmentally relevant , as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1173,"Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies , developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances , or monitoring the health implications of a disaster , GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions ."
b1g-fragment02,1174,The 1990s have been declared the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .
b1g-fragment02,1175,"Let us hope that G1S can , in some small way , help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which , as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK , can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places ."
b1g-fragment02,1176,"Research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences ."
b1g-fragment02,1177,"If , for instance , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion , assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require , for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution ."
b1g-fragment02,1178,Some researchers suggest that hazards ( and emergencies that might result ) can be regarded as either natural or technological .
b1g-fragment02,1179,"We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former ( see , for instance , Burton et al. 1978 and Perry 1981 ) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter ."
b1g-fragment02,1180,There are signs that this imbalance is being rectified ( Zeigler et al. 1983 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1181,"Hazard research , like few other GIS application areas , is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies ."
b1g-fragment02,1182,"In this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved GIS rather than for GIS looking for good problems , as is all too often the case ."
b1g-fragment02,1183,Hazard research
b1g-fragment02,1184,What are hazards ?
b1g-fragment02,1185,"Formally , a hazard can be defined as : ‰Û÷ a physical situation with a potential for human injury , damage to property , damage to the environment , or some combination of these ‰Ûª ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1186,"A hazard is a threat which , given a set of circumstances , may become translated into a realized event ."
b1g-fragment02,1187,"What we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude : we speak for instance of accidents , emergencies , disasters and catastrophes , each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences ."
b1g-fragment02,1188,"On 30 March 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century , the Bezymianny eruption , occurred ."
b1g-fragment02,1189,Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties .
b1g-fragment02,1190,"In contrast , the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when , during October 1961 , the island 's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island 's only settlement were evacuated to the UK ."
b1g-fragment02,1191,These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area .
b1g-fragment02,1192,"As noted above , the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced ."
b1g-fragment02,1193,Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates ( 1964 ) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in distinguishing public ( or what we might call societal ) hazards from private ( individual ) ones .
b1g-fragment02,1194,The further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards .
b1g-fragment02,1195,"Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods , those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers ."
b1g-fragment02,1196,"The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization ( UNDRO ) has produced a classification of disasters , derived on the basis of case data ( Table 10.1 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1197,"UNDRO recognizes three basic types of disaster : accidents , natural events , and other disasters ."
b1g-fragment02,1198,The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies .
b1g-fragment02,1199,"However , the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here ."
b1g-fragment02,1200,"It is more useful ( Johnson 1983 ) to adopt a non-partitional scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that recognizes , for instance , food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard , or lead pollution ( e.g. from car exhausts ) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard ( both public and private ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1201,"An air crash ( as at Lockerbie ) affects an entire community directly , as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller ."
b1g-fragment02,1202,Hillslope failure ( as at Aberfan in South Wales in 1966 ) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction .
b1g-fragment02,1203,Dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs .
b1g-fragment02,1204,Hohensemer et al. ( 1983 ) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored ( see Table 10.2 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1205,"These factors will , of course , be important in deciding on the role that GIS can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning ."
b1g-fragment02,1206,"For instance , some events will persist briefly , have immediate consequences , minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality ( an air crash is an example ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1207,"Others , such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas , may persist for a week or more , have delayed consequences , may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations ."
b1g-fragment02,1208,There may be more scope for a GIS approach in the latter than in the former situations .
b1g-fragment02,1209,"The Hohensemer scheme is not , however , beyond criticism ."
b1g-fragment02,1210,"for example , can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality ?"
b1g-fragment02,1211,Industrial hazards and risk assessment
b1g-fragment02,1212,Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk .
b1g-fragment02,1213,By ‰Û÷ risk ‰Ûª we understand ‰Û÷ the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances ‰Ûª ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1214,"It may , of course , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals ."
b1g-fragment02,1215,"Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare , so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk , especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency ."
b1g-fragment02,1216,"The identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known , together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there ."
b1g-fragment02,1217,In the UK ( see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview ) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled .
b1g-fragment02,1218,"Such substances and thresholds include , for instance , 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate , and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas ."
b1g-fragment02,1219,"Some 1600 installations are notifiable , along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines ( mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1220,"Following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities ( including those at Flixborough , Humberside in 1974 ; Beek , the Netherlands in 1975 ; and Seveso and Manfredonia in Italy in 1976 ) , the EC issued a Directive on Major Accident Hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1221,"The Directive , which is commonly referred to as the ‰Û÷ Seveso ‰Ûª Directive , was issued in June 1982 and in the UK its requirements were embodied in the Control of Major Accident Hazard ( CIMAH ) Regulations ( 1984 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1222,"Among other things , these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations ( Houston 1987 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1223,There are presently about 300 CIMAH sites .
b1g-fragment02,1224,"However , many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations ."
b1g-fragment02,1225,"Clearly , a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net , while large numbers of handling sites ( warehouses , for instance ) are not covered ."
b1g-fragment02,1226,"The regulations have obvious implications for G1S work , as illustrated below ."
b1g-fragment02,1227,"In Halton Borough , Cheshire , for instance , there are 13 notifiable installations , with over 20 000 people living within the defined ‰Û÷ consultation zones ‰Ûª ( Petts 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1228,It is also relevant to point out here the work of the Health and Safety Executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1229,"Such techniques include the use of a ‰Û÷ risk assessment tool ‰Ûª ( RISKAT ) , inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed ; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours ."
b1g-fragment02,1230,In societal risk assessment ‰Û÷ it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation .
b1g-fragment02,1231,"This can be a difficult and time-consuming process , and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed ‰Ûª ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 17 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1232,"Again , the G1S implications are clear and are discussed below ."
b1g-fragment02,1233,Hazardous waste disposal
b1g-fragment02,1234,The disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years .
b1g-fragment02,1235,"The rather clumsy handling by NIREX of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes , together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , are but two examples of such concern in the UK ."
b1g-fragment02,1236,"However , while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers ( summarized by Openshaw et al. 1989 ) there has been relatively little such work in the UK on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1237,"This contrasts with the situation in the USA ( Greenberg and Anderson 1984 ) , where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority ."
b1g-fragment02,1238,"Certainly , in terms of the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda ; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985‰ÛÒ86 , 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1239,Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate ( now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ) .
b1g-fragment02,1240,"These contain some valuable material on disposal practices , and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority ( WRA ) ‰ÛÓ counties in England , districts in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland ."
b1g-fragment02,1241,Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear .
b1g-fragment02,1242,"They too contain useful material on , for instance , the locations of sites , though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1243,"What is not known is information on the locations of former sites , at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped , though recent work by Egger ( 1989 ) in Austria has mapped a vast number of such sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1244,"It is these , rather than existing , licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity , particularly when examining possible links to ill health ."
b1g-fragment02,1245,"We simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that ‰Û÷ people are almost certainly ill , dead , or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities ‰Ûª ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1246,"Research is in progress , however , to assess possible health effects of poor incineration ( Diggle et al. 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1247,"Particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators , since these have been subject to Crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes ( Gatrell and Lovett 1991 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1248,"We need to produce an inventory of all such sites , together with a publicly available , comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes ."
b1g-fragment02,1249,Emergency planning
b1g-fragment02,1250,It is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning .
b1g-fragment02,1251,Nuclear emergency planning in the UK has been reviewed by Matthews and Pepper ( 1981 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1252,Nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health and Safety Executive for approval .
b1g-fragment02,1253,Evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km ; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services .
b1g-fragment02,1254,"The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA ( Collins 1981 ) , where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes ."
b1g-fragment02,1255,"Local authorities in the UK that have declared themselves ‰Û÷ nuclear-free ‰Ûª have been highly critical of British planning , calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least 24 km ."
b1g-fragment02,1256,Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island .
b1g-fragment02,1257,"In the UK little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances , nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning ."
b1g-fragment02,1258,"Indeed , no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify ."
b1g-fragment02,1259,"In the USA on the other hand , a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken ."
b1g-fragment02,1260,"This research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Tennessee ( Sorenson et al. 1987 ; Vogt and Sorenson 1987 ) and the Disaster Research Centre , University of Delaware ."
b1g-fragment02,1261,"Perry ( 1985 ) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation , covering both natural and technological hazards ."
b1g-fragment02,1262,"For him , comprehensive emergency planning and management involve : prevention , protection , response and restoration ."
b1g-fragment02,1263,"By prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk , perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments , for instance ."
b1g-fragment02,1264,Included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected .
b1g-fragment02,1265,"Response includes search and rescue ( including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion , or fire following an earthquake ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1266,"As Perry and others have noted , relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects , the bulk going to response and restoration ( rebuilding ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1267,It should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical .
b1g-fragment02,1268,In one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event Liverman and Wilson ( 1981 ) give weight to this argument .
b1g-fragment02,1269,"In 1979 a train carrying chlorine , liquid petroleum , toluene and propane was derailed in Mississauga , Ontario , causing a series of explosions ."
b1g-fragment02,1270,"This led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which , although staggered over several days , led to great pressure on transport arteries ."
b1g-fragment02,1271,"An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away , rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres ."
b1g-fragment02,1272,"Despite this , the evacuation was successful , partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated ."
b1g-fragment02,1273,"In addition , the police were well prepared , stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby Toronto International Airport than for the event in question ."
b1g-fragment02,1274,"It is not without interest to note that in the USA there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , established in 1978 , charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management ."
b1g-fragment02,1275,"In the UK there is no equivalent , though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years ( involving over 1000 lives lost ) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established ."
b1g-fragment02,1276,Natural hazards
b1g-fragment02,1277,In this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to GIS .
b1g-fragment02,1278,"Needless to say , the study of natural hazards is important , a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to 4 per cent of total deaths in the world each year ( Mitchell , 1974 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1279,"In 1970 , for example , more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of Bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes David and Frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the USA ."
b1g-fragment02,1280,Shah ( 1983 ) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974‰ÛÒ80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude ( measured in terms of lives lost ) are increasing .
b1g-fragment02,1281,"High death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed , low-income countries ."
b1g-fragment02,1282,"Surprisingly , fog is the third most important hazard in Europe after floods and volcanoes ."
b1g-fragment02,1283,Research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century .
b1g-fragment02,1284,Much of the impetus for such research arose in the USA from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage .
b1g-fragment02,1285,The vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards .
b1g-fragment02,1286,"This emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved ( many are human geographers and sociologists ) and partly because it is only really since the Second World War that major hazards have been monitored systematically , culminating , of course , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology ."
b1g-fragment02,1287,"Brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a GIS approach , applications of which are considered below ."
b1g-fragment02,1288,Jones et al. ( 1989 ) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK .
b1g-fragment02,1289,Their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the UK .
b1g-fragment02,1290,"More to the point , however , is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes , rainfall , rock types and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1291,In other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified .
b1g-fragment02,1292,"The potential benefits to insurance companies , engineers and planners are clear ."
b1g-fragment02,1293,"Second , a well-known winter hazard in the UK , with marked spatial localization , is fog ."
b1g-fragment02,1294,Predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety .
b1g-fragment02,1295,"Perry ( 1981 ) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography , environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies ."
b1g-fragment02,1296,"Reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations , often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas ; GIS could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like ."
b1g-fragment02,1297,The majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type .
b1g-fragment02,1298,This idea led Hewitt and Burton ( 1971 ) to develop the concept of ‰Û÷ all-hazards-at-a-place ‰Ûª .
b1g-fragment02,1299,To achieve this they concentrated on the M_whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact .
b1g-fragment02,1300,The implications for GIS in the development of ‰Û÷ hazardousness ‰Ûª indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps .
b1g-fragment02,1301,The collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time .
b1g-fragment02,1302,Many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence .
b1g-fragment02,1303,This is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes .
b1g-fragment02,1304,"For example , in 1692 , the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium ; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted ( Morse 1983 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1305,Presumably the builders of the Channel Tunnel are aware of this ?
b1g-fragment02,1306,Environmental epidemiology
b1g-fragment02,1307,"This is , of course , a vast subject area , embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health ."
b1g-fragment02,1308,"It covers , for instance , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health , links between geological and pedological environments and ill health , as well as associations between specific technological hazards ( e.g. high-voltage power lines ) and possible health effects ."
b1g-fragment02,1309,"We can only consider a small fraction of this work here ; little consideration is given to occupational environments , for instance ."
b1g-fragment02,1310,"In the UK such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at Southampton and Cardiff ( funded by the Medical Research Council ) , and others at the University of Surrey ( Robens Institute ) and at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ."
b1g-fragment02,1311,"The latter houses the Small Area Health Statistics Research Unit ( SAHSRU ) , which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales ( Elliot 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1312,The SAHSRU liaises closely with OPCS .
b1g-fragment02,1313,The kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below .
b1g-fragment02,1314,Greenberg ( 1983 ) and a collection of papers in Greenberg ( 1987 ) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology .
b1g-fragment02,1315,It seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed .
b1g-fragment02,1316,"One is to collect morbidity and mortality data ( usually the latter is more widely available , though the former more useful ) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering ."
b1g-fragment02,1317,This has itself generated a substantial literature ( see the papers in Elliot 1988 for an overview ) and is nowhere better exemplified than in Openshaw 's geographical analysis machine ( see Ch. 2 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1318,We then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations .
b1g-fragment02,1319,An alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis .
b1g-fragment02,1320,If an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further .
b1g-fragment02,1321,"Of course , these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice ; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping ."
b1g-fragment02,1322,One example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health .
b1g-fragment02,1323,"Some work ( Perry et al. 1981 ) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide , while others ( e.g. Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) have examined links to various cancers , including leukaemias ."
b1g-fragment02,1324,A good bibliography is provided in Perry and Pearl ( 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1325,"The Central Electricity Generating Board ( now privatized and split into two companies ) is funding a large-scale , 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer , while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death ."
b1g-fragment02,1326,"One obvious problem , with implications for any GIS input , is that the effects are highly localized , with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines ."
b1g-fragment02,1327,Accuracy of digital data collection ( either of the power lines or residential locations ) is paramount .
b1g-fragment02,1328,There seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment .
b1g-fragment02,1329,"GIS work in this field ( e.g. Matthews 1989 ) is reviewed later , but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at Imperial College ( responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry ) and the existence of a Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health ."
b1g-fragment02,1330,One area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer .
b1g-fragment02,1331,"This is taken very seriously in the USA , where the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 10 000‰ÛÒ20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure ."
b1g-fragment02,1332,Estimates from Scandinavia suggest that 10‰ÛÒ30 per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon ( Richardson 1988 : 270‰ÛÒ81 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1333,The gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil ; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of Cornwall and Devon .
b1g-fragment02,1334,"There are great difficulties in assessing health effects , however , since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods ."
b1g-fragment02,1335,Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors .
b1g-fragment02,1336,Other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the Regional Research Laboratory ( RRL ) initiative include air and water pollution .
b1g-fragment02,1337,"The debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known ; less publicity has been given to PAHs ( polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons ) , a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic ( Lioy and Daisey 1987 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1338,Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory ( NWRRL ) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer .
b1g-fragment02,1339,"Those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the Warren Springs Laboratory , containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the UK ."
b1g-fragment02,1340,"The possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate ( Beresford 1985 ) , as is the association between aluminium content and Alzheimer 's disease ."
b1g-fragment02,1341,"The problems of assessing such links are , of course , huge , but there is scope for a contribution ."
b1g-fragment02,1342,The role of GIS in hazard management scenarios ‰ÛÓ examples
b1g-fragment02,1343,"As we have already implied , GIS has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research , from hazard monitoring , risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences ."
b1g-fragment02,1344,"The examples described below illustrate all these , though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part ."
b1g-fragment02,1345,"Technological hazards , emergency planning and GIS"
b1g-fragment02,1346,A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply GIS methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites .
b1g-fragment02,1347,Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system .
b1g-fragment02,1348,"Reference was made above to so-called CIMAH sites , major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared ."
b1g-fragment02,1349,"Early research at the NWRRL focused on developing a GIS for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in Cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in Whitehaven , west Cumbria ( Vincent et al. 1988 ; Dunn 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1350,The police required a portable system that could be implemented on an IBM-compatible microcomputer .
b1g-fragment02,1351,This was written at the NWRRL using FORTRAN 77 and the Graphical Kernel System .
b1g-fragment02,1352,The GIS is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly ( Pl. 10.1 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1353,It opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners .
b1g-fragment02,1354,Full zoom facilities are available at any stage .
b1g-fragment02,1355,In any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources .
b1g-fragment02,1356,The system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data .
b1g-fragment02,1357,"Both sets of data were provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd , who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country ."
b1g-fragment02,1358,"Other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools , medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained ."
b1g-fragment02,1359,The GIS permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map .
b1g-fragment02,1360,"Most significantly , it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes ."
b1g-fragment02,1361,"Although predating the RRL initiative by several years ‰ÛÓ and , indeed the emergence of GIS as a major research area ‰ÛÓ we should remind ourselves of Openshaw 's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1362,"Using what would now be called GIS skills , Openshaw ( 1980 ) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the UK which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 Census ( which were made available for such grid squares ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1363,"He demonstrated that there is an abundance of ‰Û÷ remote ‰Ûª sites , in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find ."
b1g-fragment02,1364,He suggested that in early spatial searches for sites ‰Û÷ only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data ‰Ûª ( Openshaw 1980 : 289 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1365,Heywood and Cornelius ( 1989 ) have shown how GIS can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of GIS in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring .
b1g-fragment02,1366,"They propose a national radiological spatial information system and , in a pilot project in Cumbria , have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve ( Fig. 10.2 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1367,Such data include those from the Population and Agricultural Censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations .
b1g-fragment02,1368,"As an example , the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 ."
b1g-fragment02,1369,This is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations .
b1g-fragment02,1370,"The map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , with the exception of a small area to the south-east of Cumbria , bordering on Lancashire ."
b1g-fragment02,1371,The British government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the Chernobyl accident .
b1g-fragment02,1372,"The DoE , through Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ( HMIP ) , was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan , installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency ( HMSO 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1373,"The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network ( RIMNET ) and has , as its prime responsibility , the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident ."
b1g-fragment02,1374,The full implementation of the RIMNET system will take some time .
b1g-fragment02,1375,By the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme .
b1g-fragment02,1376,Radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data .
b1g-fragment02,1377,"The current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background , either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1378,"The dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels : the first is the normal system of press notices ; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ( Ceefax and Prestel ) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work ; the third is the use of Telecom Gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies , such as water authorities ( Jackson 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1379,Phase 2 of the RIMNET scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established .
b1g-fragment02,1380,"Given very wide regional and local variations in deposition , questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network ; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks ."
b1g-fragment02,1381,There are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later .
b1g-fragment02,1382,"Abroad , Kaspar ( 1981 ) has discussed a computer-based exercise , with GIS overtones , involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in Baden WÌ_rttemberg ."
b1g-fragment02,1383,"In the scenario he outlines , an area affected by radioactive releases is determined , the population within that area is allocated to reception areas ( with capacity constraints ) , evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented ."
b1g-fragment02,1384,"Little detail is provided , however , and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully ."
b1g-fragment02,1385,Dangermond ( 1985 ) describes the use of the ARC/INFO NETWORK module for use in emergency planning situations .
b1g-fragment02,1386,"He describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation , districting and routeing algorithms ."
b1g-fragment02,1387,"Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre ; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest ( districts ) and to summarize their characteristics ; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network , the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions , road capacity and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1388,"Dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of NETWORK for the allocation of emergency vehicles , optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks ."
b1g-fragment02,1389,"When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO , quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled ."
b1g-fragment02,1390,"For example , earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model ."
b1g-fragment02,1391,Vincent ( 1989 ) illustrates the use of ARC/INFO and its NETWORK module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west England ( Pl. 10.2 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1392,"In this case , population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm ."
b1g-fragment02,1393,Chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance .
b1g-fragment02,1394,Hazardous waste disposal
b1g-fragment02,1395,"There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize ( rather than , as conventionally , maximize ) accessibility to a population ."
b1g-fragment02,1396,A particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear ( but none the less hazardous ) wastes .
b1g-fragment02,1397,We discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes .
b1g-fragment02,1398,The major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers ( Openshaw et al. 1989 ) and a GIS approach to this problem can pay high dividends .
b1g-fragment02,1399,The work of Carver ( see Openshaw et al. 1989 : Ch. 7 ) is an interesting example .
b1g-fragment02,1400,One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation .
b1g-fragment02,1401,"Conceptually , what is offered is little more than an automated ‰Û÷ sieve mapping ‰Ûª that land-use planners have used for many years , but the M_whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software ."
b1g-fragment02,1402,The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories ( which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter ) .
b1g-fragment02,1403,"Data layers include geological maps , conservation areas , transport routes , petrochemical facilities and demographic data ."
b1g-fragment02,1404,"As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks ( Pl. 10.3 ) ; for instance , when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository , 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent ."
b1g-fragment02,1405,"However , adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent ; and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1406,We can not pretend GIS is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public .
b1g-fragment02,1407,GIS research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in North America and has yet to be matched in the UK .
b1g-fragment02,1408,"Jensen and Christiansen ( 1986 ) , working in the south-eastern USA , use a raster approach ( with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2 ; ) and Boolean overlay to ‰Û÷ weed out ‰Ûª particular sites , such as those which are poorly drained , environmentally sensitive or inaccessible ( see also Stewart 1987 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1409,Environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the USA .
b1g-fragment02,1410,"The Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) legislation of 1980 ( ‰Û÷ Superfund ‰Ûª ) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites , of which some 800 had been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency by 1986 ( Foresman 1986 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1411,A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this ( Merchant et al. 1987 ; Barringer et al. 1987 ; von Braun 1988 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1412,"This is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural households in the USA consume only groundwater , while half the US population consumes at least some groundwater ( Merchant et al. 1987 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1413,"Clearly , the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data , usually in three dimensions ."
b1g-fragment02,1414,"As Foresman ( 1986 ) suggests , we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role ."
b1g-fragment02,1415,"Merchant et al. ( 1987 ) for example , use the image processing system ERDAS to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution ; this uses variables such as depth to water table , soil type , slope and so on ( see Estes et al. 1987 for a similar approach ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1416,Barringer et al. ( 1987 ) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality ( hardness and corrosivity measures ) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices .
b1g-fragment02,1417,"Again , a raster-based approach is used ."
b1g-fragment02,1418,"A further example is work by von Braun ( 1988 ) who uses pMAP to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of Tucson airport , Arizona ."
b1g-fragment02,1419,Using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated .
b1g-fragment02,1420,Overlaying the results with residential location data provides ‰Û÷ maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period ‰Ûª ( von Braun 1988 ; 1160 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1421,"In principle , it is then possible to compare such ‰Û÷ doses ‰Ûª with epidemiological data , once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes ."
b1g-fragment02,1422,Attention should be drawn to Foresman 's comment that the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) ( at the EROS Data Centre ) have successfully linked ARC/INFO to a model of groundwater flow ( Foresman 1986 : 260 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1423,This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models .
b1g-fragment02,1424,Natural hazards and disaster management
b1g-fragment02,1425,Several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of GIS in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards .
b1g-fragment02,1426,"Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) , for example , describe a GIS for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the Texas Gulf coast ."
b1g-fragment02,1427,Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA .
b1g-fragment02,1428,"It has been estimated , for example , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million US citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge ( Brinkman 1975 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1429,"The system described by Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called SLOSH ( Sea , Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1430,"SLOSH is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities , angles of approach to the shoreline , forward movement speeds and landfall locations ."
b1g-fragment02,1431,Additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves .
b1g-fragment02,1432,Hobeika and Jamei ( 1985 ) describe the MASSeVACuation ( MASSVAC ) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area .
b1g-fragment02,1433,The system comprises three interrelated modules : community and disaster type characteristics module ; population distribution module ; network evacuation module .
b1g-fragment02,1434,The type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated .
b1g-fragment02,1435,The control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario .
b1g-fragment02,1436,MASSVAC is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as : traffic signal timings on the road network ; one-way traffic ; reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services .
b1g-fragment02,1437,Hobeika and Jamei have tested MASSVAC on various evacuation scenarios for Virginia Beach City in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions .
b1g-fragment02,1438,"In general , they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times ."
b1g-fragment02,1439,Southworth et al. ( 1989 ) have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL .
b1g-fragment02,1440,This module has been developed using IBM 's Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens .
b1g-fragment02,1441,"The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams ."
b1g-fragment02,1442,The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .
b1g-fragment02,1443,"In dry parts of the world , such as Australia , forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts ."
b1g-fragment02,1444,"Kessell ( 1988 ) describes a PC-based GIS called PREPLAN ( PRistine Environment Planning LANguage ) which is a natural area management , land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service , PREPLAN comprises four modules : a simple raster-based GIS ; a grid cell resource database ; a wide range of vegetation , fuel , fire behaviour , erosion and land-use models ; tabular , statistical and colour graphics output system ."
b1g-fragment02,1445,"With this system real-time fire growth can be modelled , taking into account changes in terrain , fuel and temporal changes in the weather ."
b1g-fragment02,1446,"Kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of Australia , causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life ."
b1g-fragment02,1447,Systems such as PREPLAN can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning .
b1g-fragment02,1448,"One of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding , and the potential for loss of property , risk to life and general social disruption is large ."
b1g-fragment02,1449,"One interesting example of a GIS approach to flood damage estimation is the ANUFLOOD package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern New South Wales , Australia ( Smith and Greenaway , 1988 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1450,"The ANUFLOOD system requires locational and building type data on individual properties , stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type , and lastly , flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability ."
b1g-fragment02,1451,Output from the system is both tabular and graphical .
b1g-fragment02,1452,Of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas .
b1g-fragment02,1453,"ANUFLOOD also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options , such as property height raising , levee construction and flood proofing ."
b1g-fragment02,1454,Environmental epidemiology
b1g-fragment02,1455,"The possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning , the search for hazardous sites , and risk assessment ."
b1g-fragment02,1456,To what extent can GIS help if an event occurs ?
b1g-fragment02,1457,"What , for instance , of the health consequences ?"
b1g-fragment02,1458,There is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for GIS applications is wide ( Gatrell 1987 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1459,"For instance , Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this ."
b1g-fragment02,1460,This would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data ( increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries ) to Ordnance Survey ( OS ) grid references .
b1g-fragment02,1461,"Such a link is provided by the Central Postcode Directory , which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the UK to grid references ."
b1g-fragment02,1462,When the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution ( provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer ) the hypothesis is given strong support .
b1g-fragment02,1463,"Although the proposed method is novel , it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model ‰Û÷ clusters ‰Ûª of disease ( see , for example , Cuzick and Edwards 1990 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1464,"The work of Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) examined only a single point source , though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well ."
b1g-fragment02,1465,As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross ( 1989 ) on childhood leukaemia .
b1g-fragment02,1466,There are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease ( from ionizing radiation to viral transmission ) and Cross 's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use ARC/INFO to display and analyse results .
b1g-fragment02,1467,"For instance , one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation , a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier ."
b1g-fragment02,1468,If these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them ( Fig. 10.3 ) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside .
b1g-fragment02,1469,"However , we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data , since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m ( Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1470,"There has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of Wales may be linked to soil chemistry , specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios , and to lead content in water supplies ."
b1g-fragment02,1471,Matthews ( 1989 ) has used data from the Regional Cancer Registry ( morbidity rather than mortality data ) and data on trace elements to examine this link .
b1g-fragment02,1472,Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference .
b1g-fragment02,1473,"As with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration , together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors ."
b1g-fragment02,1474,"In the USA , Morrill 's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the Hanford ( Washington State ) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for GIS skills to be applied ( Morrill 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1475,The research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records .
b1g-fragment02,1476,To some extent this line of approach was anticipated by Johnson ( 1981 ) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver ( see Zeigler et al. 1983 : 47‰ÛÒ8 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1477,"Using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands , detecting a marked distance decay effect ."
b1g-fragment02,1478,Research problems and prospects
b1g-fragment02,1479,"The work reviewed above suggests that the application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment , emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems ."
b1g-fragment02,1480,"Undoubtedly , the GISs of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors ."
b1g-fragment02,1481,"Computer power is becoming cheaper , digital data more readily available , and GISs are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies ."
b1g-fragment02,1482,In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them .
b1g-fragment02,1483,"Doubtless there are many others , such is the surge of interest in GIS technology ."
b1g-fragment02,1484,Data availability
b1g-fragment02,1485,"We should first M_consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be M_at risk M_from the storage and transport of hazardous substances , M_from toxic air pollution , M_from flooding and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1486,"Such data are crucial , either for assisting the emergency services to M_make M_assessments M_about M_resources they need to M_deploy M_in such events , or for M_high-quality estimates to be M_made of risk ."
b1g-fragment02,1487,"M_Within the public M_domain in the UK we must rely in general M_on data M_from the most recent Population Census , the M_lowest M_level being M_that for enumeration districts ( EDs ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1488,As is well known ( Rhind 1983 ) M_these contain M_on average perhaps 150‰ÛÒ200 households and 400‰ÛÒ500 people .
b1g-fragment02,1489,"The M_boundaries EDs have not been widely digitized , unlike the M_higher-level electoral wards ."
b1g-fragment02,1490,"However , the centroids of EDs are available as 100 m M_grid references and artificial ED ‰Û÷ polygons ‰Ûª can be created if necessary ."
b1g-fragment02,1491,M_In some instances such data will suffice ; M_in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available .
b1g-fragment02,1492,But in some areas EDs are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted .
b1g-fragment02,1493,"Furthermore , the M_scales M_at which population estimates are often required means that even EDs are too M_coarse for risk M_assessments ."
b1g-fragment02,1494,"For instance , M_in performing its quantitative risk M_assessments the Health and Safety Executive will rarely M_deal M_with distances from hazardous sites in excess of 1 km ( Petts 1988 ) and census data will not M_offer sufficient M_resolution for M_accurate population estimates to be M_made ."
b1g-fragment02,1495,"It should be M_pointed M_out , however , that the National Radiological Protection Board currently M_uses 1 km M_grid square resolution population data M_from the 1971 Census M_in its radiological protection studies ( Hallam et al. 1981 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1496,"It would seem that , despite the costs involved , they should M_consider investing M_in the very detailed digital data ( Pinpoint Address Code ( PAC ) ) provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd ."
b1g-fragment02,1497,M_This M_area of M_application would appear to be an obvious M_market for such a product .
b1g-fragment02,1498,A useful research M_exercise would be to compare the use of census and PAC data M_in M_deriving quantitative risk M_assessments and M_this is an interesting research problem .
b1g-fragment02,1499,Even M_with PAC data some M_assumptions would need to be M_made M_about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be M_made .
b1g-fragment02,1500,"More generally , we need to M_consider the availability of M_large databases for hazard studies and emergency M_planning and M_this is an M_area M_ripe for major initiatives ."
b1g-fragment02,1501,In the UK we seem to be M_lagging well M_behind the USA M_in the M_construction of databases M_on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as M_those involving toxic M_releases .
b1g-fragment02,1502,"For instance , Lioy and Daisey ( 1987 ) , M_in their work M_on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in New Jersey , M_construct what they term a ‰Û÷ M_microinventory ‰Ûª for each of three towns , comprising the locations of chemical M_plants , metal processing M_plants , paint spray manufacturers and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1503,Some attribute information is available for M_these .
b1g-fragment02,1504,"More M_closely M_linked M_to GIS is work by McMaster and Johnson ( 1986 ) who perform a very detailed M_inventory of hazardous materials ( both stored and transported ) in Santa Monica , California ."
b1g-fragment02,1505,"Although the raster M_displays are very M_crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people ( for instance , particular age groups ) M_within certain distances of toxic hazard sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1506,"We M_have data M_on some hazardous sites ( e.g. M_those M_regulated by CIMAH ) in the UK but a much more comprehensive M_approach should be M_adopted , especially if we are serious M_in the M_search for environmental M_associations M_with chronic diseases ."
b1g-fragment02,1507,The same is true for toxic M_releases .
b1g-fragment02,1508,"In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency M_produces an Acute Hazards Events Database while the Department of Transportation M_has a database M_recording details of 25 000 M_releases of toxic materials ; such details M_include locational information , type and amount of material M_released , mode of M_release and resulting injuries or deaths ( Cutter and Solecki 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1509,"Can we not use GIS technology to M_construct ‰Û÷ risk M_mosaics ‰Ûª ( Zeigler et al. 1983 ) , M_at a variety of spatial M_scales , akin M_to Hewitt and Burton 's ‰Û÷ hazardousness ‰Ûª of a place ?"
b1g-fragment02,1510,"In the UK only a M_handful of county emergency M_planning departments ( Cumbria , for instance ) have M_built M_up M_resource databases M_in digital M_form and M_this needs to be promoted ."
b1g-fragment02,1511,"M_Further M_afield , we need to M_recognize that some disasters ( most obviously Chernobyl ) will M_have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should M_take M_place M_with some kind of international M_co-ordination ."
b1g-fragment02,1512,"There will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk M_assessment and M_planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries , or at sea and airports ."
b1g-fragment02,1513,"As noted M_above , the work of Fedra ( 1989 ) is a major M_step M_in M_this M_direction , and M_links need to be M_forged M_between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe ."
b1g-fragment02,1514,"In terms of databases M_on hazardous wastes , attention has already been M_drawn M_to the waste disposal M_plans M_prepared by WRAs ."
b1g-fragment02,1515,"M_These M_give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes , though little or no information M_on M_closed and abandoned sites ."
b1g-fragment02,1516,"However , for details of disposal the individual site licences must be M_consulted ."
b1g-fragment02,1517,"The former Hazardous Waste Inspectorate M_operated a M_large database M_on all sites , M_with details of permitted wastes , including allowable quantities ."
b1g-fragment02,1518,"The database was created by a commercial company , Aspinwalls Ltd ."
b1g-fragment02,1519,There are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work .
b1g-fragment02,1520,"OPCS , of course , is a major data M_repository for medical statistics and their various Monitor Series are of use , though only M_at the M_scale of district health authority and M_above ( see Gatrell and Lovett 1988 for an example ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1521,Regional health authorities will from time to time M_produce mortality data M_at ward M_level .
b1g-fragment02,1522,"However , if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to M_obtain data M_from regional cancer registries ; M_these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more M_valuable ."
b1g-fragment02,1523,The data are postcoded and may M_have some occupational details .
b1g-fragment02,1524,"For example , we have received data M_from the Regional Cancer Registry in Manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified M_between 1974 and 1984 ."
b1g-fragment02,1525,"M_This M_large data M_set , M_to which M_grid references have now been added , comprises information M_about nearly 40 000 individuals ."
b1g-fragment02,1526,"It has now been M_copied M_into INGRES , a relational database management M_system , M_permitting queries to be M_made M_about M_subsets of the data ; for instance , all males M_between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering M_from laryngeal cancer ."
b1g-fragment02,1527,Other data M_sources M_on cancers are independent registries of malignancies .
b1g-fragment02,1528,"An example is M_that M_on leukaemias , managed by the Leukaemia Research Fund M_Centre in Leeds ( Alexander et al. 1989 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1529,"It should be M_noted that there are frequently major discrepancies M_between the regional registries and the specialist registries , partly because the latter M_receive notifications M_directly M_from consultants ."
b1g-fragment02,1530,"Indeed , working M_directly with consultants proves invaluable M_in M_gaining M_access M_to M_high-quality morbidity data ."
b1g-fragment02,1531,Two other potential M_sources of data are M_worth M_mentioning .
b1g-fragment02,1532,"First , attention should be M_drawn M_to the new directive M_from the Department of Health M_to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population ."
b1g-fragment02,1533,"M_This means M_in practice that district medical officers are M_charged M_with preparing an annual report , M_presenting and interpreting epidemiological data , identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes ."
b1g-fragment02,1534,Lancaster University is already M_heavily involved M_in the work of Preston District Health Authority in M_this area .
b1g-fragment02,1535,"Second , family health service authorities ( FHSAs ) , are also required to M_take M_on M_these M_roles , but M_from the M_viewpoint of primary health care services ."
b1g-fragment02,1536,"FHSAs ( which correspond M_to non-metropolitan counties and M_to metropolitan boroughs ) M_hold M_large databases M_on services provided by general practitioners ; for instance , uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers ."
b1g-fragment02,1537,"Is it , we wonder , possible to M_contemplate bringing together some of M_these data M_sources to M_form a National Online Health Information M_System ( NOHIS ) , to M_parallel M_that for employment and unemployment ( Townsend et al. 1987 ) ?"
b1g-fragment02,1538,"M_This might M_include data M_on morbidity and mortality , uptake of preventative medicine , service use and availability , M_at both primary and hospital M_level ."
b1g-fragment02,1539,"It would be a useful management M_tool , particularly in view of the reorganization M_taking M_place M_in the National Health Service ."
b1g-fragment02,1540,It should not be forgotten that hazards themselves M_have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the UK to develop public M_domain databases .
b1g-fragment02,1541,Are there M_hazard-prone areas ?
b1g-fragment02,1542,Is there a regional differentiation M_in hazard type ?
b1g-fragment02,1543,"M_These are , of course , commercially important M_questions and a good M_deal of money is M_going M_into the M_collection of such data by insurance companies ."
b1g-fragment02,1544,One well known database is Major Hazard Incident Data Service ( MHIDAS ) global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the Safety and Reliability Directorate on behalf of the Major Hazards M_Assessment Unit of the UK Health and Safety Directorate .
b1g-fragment02,1545,M_This M_system currently M_runs M_in dBASE II and M_contains in excess of 3000 M_items of professionally M_assessed information M_on major hazards coded M_into some 24 separate M_fields .
b1g-fragment02,1546,"Unfortunately , the spatial referencing is M_poor and M_with some effort M_this could easily be remedied ."
b1g-fragment02,1547,"It is , for example , little use when recording a chemical spill into an Egyptian river to have M_entered M_into the appropriate M_field ‰Û÷ the Nile ‰Ûª ‰ÛÓ M_after all , M_this river is some 6480 km long !"
b1g-fragment02,1548,"M_Here , M_in our M_view , is a classic case of the absence of a geographical M_input M_rendering the data of limited M_value ."
b1g-fragment02,1549,"M_In some cases , good hazard data exist but have simply not yet M_found their M_way M_into a GIS ."
b1g-fragment02,1550,A case M_in M_point is inland and coastal flooding .
b1g-fragment02,1551,Most river authorities have detailed maps M_showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their M_return periods .
b1g-fragment02,1552,"M_Within the next decade , as the privatized water companies develop their GIS , we shall see a M_massive amount of data conversion M_in M_this M_area ."
b1g-fragment02,1553,"M_This development , together M_with the availability of digital terrain M_models , will M_allow quite M_sophisticated flood forecasting M_models to be developed M_within a GIS M_framework ."
b1g-fragment02,1554,"As sea-levels rise M_in the next 20‰ÛÒ30 years due to the ‰Û÷ greenhouse ‰Ûª effect , M_this very practical use of GIS technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance ."
b1g-fragment02,1555,Spatial statistics
b1g-fragment02,1556,Another M_way M_in which there needs to be a M_rapprochement M_between statistical methods and GIS is M_in the M_area of spatial M_sampling and estimation M_from spatial M_samples .
b1g-fragment02,1557,M_This is clearly an important issue M_in radiation monitoring as the M_discussion of RIMNET M_above M_implies .
b1g-fragment02,1558,"As an example , Peirson ( 1988 ) has reviewed the evidence M_on artificial radioactivity in Cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces ."
b1g-fragment02,1559,The M_point M_worth M_making M_here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating M_from irregular M_point data ( Lam 1983 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1560,"One method in particular , kriging ( now available as M_part of the UNIRAS software ) , M_offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map ."
b1g-fragment02,1561,Where M_this is M_high it M_suggests that an additional M_sampling station might be set up .
b1g-fragment02,1562,Such techniques are now standard M_in environmental science ( see Streit 1981 for an M_application M_to rainfall monitoring ) and need to be promoted M_vigorously M_in hazard studies ( Estes et al. 1987 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1563,M_Related M_to M_this problem is M_that of M_making population estimates for new zones that result M_from M_overlay M_operations .
b1g-fragment02,1564,"We may want to count numbers living M_within M_plumes , circles of M_fixed radius , buffer zones and so on ."
b1g-fragment02,1565,"Existing GIS techniques usually M_base the estimates M_on area-weighted M_shares , so that a new polygon created by ‰Û÷ M_slicing ‰Ûª an existing area M_in half is M_assigned M_half the population of M_that M_source unit ."
b1g-fragment02,1566,"M_This may be quite absurd M_in some cases , notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ED ."
b1g-fragment02,1567,"M_At the NWRRL work is under way ( Flowerdew and Green 1989 ) to solve such problems using the EM algorithm and the statistical M_modelling M_package GLIM , which has been M_interfaced M_with ARC/INFO ."
b1g-fragment02,1568,M_Operations research methods and simulation
b1g-fragment02,1569,While there is some research activity M_in M_linking statistical M_models M_to GIS there would seem to be scope for further M_applications of M_operations research techniques M_to GIS problems .
b1g-fragment02,1570,"M_Within some M_sophisticated GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms ( such as M_shortest M_path calculations ) , but GIS developers have in general M_failed to realize the natural M_links M_between GIS functions and many M_operations research techniques ."
b1g-fragment02,1571,M_Over the last 20 years or so a M_large theoretical literature has been developed to provide M_tools for the M_solution of many problems associated M_with emergency M_planning ( Kolesar 1981 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1572,One important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units .
b1g-fragment02,1573,"The choice of locations need not be for permanent bases , but can also M_include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances M_dictate ( Kolesar and Walker 1974 ) ."
b1g-fragment02,1574,M_In any major emergency a typical problem is the M_assignment of M_resources M_to demands .
b1g-fragment02,1575,"If M_resources are M_held M_at one set of locations and the demands are M_at another and the costs of transportation are known , how do we allocate the M_resources most efficiently ?"
b1g-fragment02,1576,"M_In a major emergency , for example , there might be a need to supply blood products M_held M_at regional blood banks to hospitals ."
b1g-fragment02,1577,"M_This , of course , is the classic transportation problem and its M_solution is well known ."
b1g-fragment02,1578,"As M_far as we know the M_microcomputer-based emergency M_response M_system devised by Belardo et al. ( 1983 ) , is the only GIS-like software to incorporate M_this algorithm ."
b1g-fragment02,1579,"M_In M_this M_system , the M_solution M_to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network , which is displayed on the computer screen ."
b1g-fragment02,1580,As a last example of the potential M_role of M_operations research M_in GIS and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that M_faced the Peel Regional Police Force during the Mississauga evacuation M_mentioned previously ( Scanlon and Padgham 1980 ) .
b1g-fragment02,1581,During the early M_states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem M_facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to M_make ready for evacuation .
b1g-fragment02,1582,Speed was of the M_essence and manpower was limited .
b1g-fragment02,1583,"M_Here , then , is a familiar M_operations research M_network problem : all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum ."
b1g-fragment02,1584,"M_This is the so-called M_Chinese M_postman M_problem , which provides a Hamiltonian circuit through the arcs ( as compared M_with the M_travelling M_salesman M_problem which is a minimum M_route M_through the M_network M_nodes ) ."
bpa-fragment14,2036,Grant 's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag .
bpa-fragment14,2037,"M_Tense , facing outwards , Forster , Lawton and Nell guarded Delaney as he intoned the seaman 's prayer of interment , and then M_committed the canvas bag M_to the ocean ."
bpa-fragment14,2038,"The storm was abating rapidly , the evening sky M_clearing M_in the west M_with the M_golden rays of the M_setting sun M_adding a M_dying colour M_to the M_sullen slate blue water ."
bpa-fragment14,2039,"The whiteness of the canvas body-bag M_dimmed beneath the onrushing sea , M_faded at the edges , then grew smaller , greener , and was M_gone ."
bpa-fragment14,2040,"They returned to the bridge , fearful of every dark place ‰ÛÓ every corner , every door ."
bpa-fragment14,2041,"The gangway lamps seemed to M_give no light , only M_add further M_to the gloom of the dusk ."
bpa-fragment14,2042,"M_Back in the wheelhouse , Delaney faced them ."
bpa-fragment14,2043,‰Û÷ Right .
bpa-fragment14,2044,You all know the M_score .
bpa-fragment14,2045,As I M_see it we 've M_got two choices .
bpa-fragment14,2046,"One , we get out of here now ."
bpa-fragment14,2047,"Launch the lifeboat , M_take our chances , or ‰Û_ two , we go M_after whatever it is . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2048,Nobody spoke immediately .
bpa-fragment14,2049,"Finally Forster glanced M_at Lawton for M_support , and drawled laconically ."
bpa-fragment14,2050,‰Û÷ I 'm not leaving here until we 've M_done for M_that M_bastard .
bpa-fragment14,2051,It 's personal from now on M_in ! ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2052,Lawton nodded his agreement .
bpa-fragment14,2053,"‰Û÷ Yes , ‰Ûª he said , ‰Û÷ I M_feel the same . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2054,‰Û÷ Nell ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2055,"Delaney asked , looking M_at her squarely ."
bpa-fragment14,2056,"‰Û÷ I agree , ‰Ûª she said M_without hesitation ."
bpa-fragment14,2057,"Their M_tense , M_edgy faces M_watched Delaney M_closely ."
bpa-fragment14,2058,"‰Û÷ We do n't know what we 're M_up M_against , ‰Ûª Delaney said , ‰Û÷ so let's M_proceed M_with maximum caution . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2059,"‰Û÷ Trouble is , ‰Ûª Lawton said , M_with a frown , ‰Û÷ there are n't enough of us to search the ship ."
bpa-fragment14,2060,"It can M_work its M_way past us , and hide again ."
bpa-fragment14,2061,We could still be looking for it when they M_blow us out of the water . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2062,"‰Û÷ M_That 's why we 've got to M_take risks , ‰Ûª Nell M_put M_in ."
bpa-fragment14,2063,"‰Û÷ M_Lure it M_into a M_trap , somehow ."
bpa-fragment14,2064,And quickly .
bpa-fragment14,2065,Forster 's chuckle was mirthless .
bpa-fragment14,2066,‰Û÷ I do n't think M_this M_joker is going to need much encouragement . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2067,‰Û÷ No . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2068,Delaney was momentarily thoughtful .
bpa-fragment14,2069,"‰Û÷ What M_had you M_in mind , Nell ? ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2070,"She pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner , and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack M_lying beside it ."
bpa-fragment14,2071,‰Û÷ Two of our number have been killed .
bpa-fragment14,2072,Each time when they were M_on their own .
bpa-fragment14,2073,"Let's M_give it the same conditions , only M_this time we use that as the M_bait . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2074,They looked M_at the ‰Û÷ M_man ‰Ûª Forster had found .
bpa-fragment14,2075,"It was a safety suit , an advanced model of the NBC type with its own oxygen tanks ."
bpa-fragment14,2076,"‰Û÷ One M_in ambush , M_with the rest of us acting like M_beaters ."
bpa-fragment14,2077,"Start at one end of the ship , M_making as much noise as possible . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2078,Forster grunted .
bpa-fragment14,2079,‰Û÷ It M_had no trouble finding Grant .
bpa-fragment14,2080,I think it 's a good idea .
bpa-fragment14,2081,And I 'll go in the suit until we M_reach the ambush M_point .
bpa-fragment14,2082,Might help to M_draw it . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2083,"They helped him kit up , Nell connecting the M_leads from the back pack into the suit attachments ."
bpa-fragment14,2084,Forster 's breathing M_whistled out of the one-way valve .
bpa-fragment14,2085,"Behind the clear , wide vizor , he tried to smile ."
bpa-fragment14,2086,"‰Û÷ Cosy in here , ‰Ûª he joked ."
bpa-fragment14,2087,‰Û÷ Even got my own toilet .
bpa-fragment14,2088,Bloody M_handy M_in the circumstances . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2089,Delaney M_took the lead .
bpa-fragment14,2090,"It was now light , the lamps on the gangway M_giving M_murky yellow M_pools that barely M_pushed M_back the M_inky blackness of a starless night ."
bpa-fragment14,2091,At the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks .
bpa-fragment14,2092,"Ineffectual or not M_against lingering gases it seemed a M_wise precaution , even if it was only psychological ."
bpa-fragment14,2093,Delaney glanced back M_at them .
bpa-fragment14,2094,‰Û÷ Let's M_make sure it M_knows where we are . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2095,They M_made noise ; slammed doors .
bpa-fragment14,2096,Nell shuddered .
bpa-fragment14,2097,Were unseen eyes watching them ?
bpa-fragment14,2098,"Was it even now M_shadowing them , moving soundlessly from cover to cover , like a M_tiger M_in the M_steel M_jungle ?"
bpa-fragment14,2099,Forster 's M_radio-projected voice M_broke M_into her thoughts .
bpa-fragment14,2100,‰Û÷ Looks a good place . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2101,He was at the entrance to the M_secure lab zone .
bpa-fragment14,2102,"‰Û÷ This must be the only way in , ‰Ûª Nell said ."
bpa-fragment14,2103,Forster was quickly de-suited .
bpa-fragment14,2104,"As they set up the now empty suit M_with its M_back M_to the door , half M_slumped over a control panel , he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers ."
bpa-fragment14,2105,Delaney 's voice was hushed .
bpa-fragment14,2106,‰Û÷ Maybe we should leave two of us here ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2107,‰Û÷ Do n't want to M_rouse any suspicions .
bpa-fragment14,2108,Forster was adamant .
bpa-fragment14,2109,"‰Û÷ M_After all , it might be M_able to count . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2110,"When he did n't M_get any response , he patted the Uzi beside him on the steel floor ."
bpa-fragment14,2111,‰Û÷ I wo n't be unprepared like M_poor M_old Grant . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2112,"Delaney pulled the curtain across , covering Forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic , widening it to M_give himself a better M_field of view ."
bpa-fragment14,2113,Lawton came and crouched down in front of it .
bpa-fragment14,2114,"‰Û÷ I 've M_left the suit 's radio M_on M_full , ‰Ûª he said ."
bpa-fragment14,2115,‰Û÷ M_Make it sound interesting if we talk occasionally . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2116,He hesitated .
bpa-fragment14,2117,‰Û÷ Good luck . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2118,"‰Û÷ I feel like a M_Maharajah M_waiting for the M_tiger to M_pounce M_on the M_tied-up M_goat , ‰Ûª Forster grinned ."
bpa-fragment14,2119,‰Û÷ I hope I do n't have to wait all night . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2120,Nell shuddered .
bpa-fragment14,2121,Night .
bpa-fragment14,2122,M_This was a night M_in their minds ‰ÛÓ a creature M_from the M_darker M_side of man 's intellect .
bpa-fragment14,2123,Something worried her M_about M_that thought .
bpa-fragment14,2124,Something M_hidden M_behind the more obvious sentiment .
bpa-fragment14,2125,"After they 'd gone , Forster M_felt the silence physically M_settle M_around him ."
bpa-fragment14,2126,"He 'd never been one to M_exercise an M_over-imagination , yet the conditions were like the M_feeling of a M_tomb ‰ÛÓ of an M_interment ."
bpa-fragment14,2127,"Would he be found , he mused , a thousand years M_from then , a dust-covered skeleton ?"
bpa-fragment14,2128,He chuckled .
bpa-fragment14,2129,"And the Uzi a M_primitive weapon , the bio suit mistaken for some sort of M_ceremonial M_armour ?"
bpa-fragment14,2130,The first stunning silence M_gave M_way M_to the creaking of the ship and a far-off booming of the sea against the hull .
bpa-fragment14,2131,The radio on the M_dummy suddenly M_screeched M_into M_action as Delaney 's distorted voice M_gave it M_life .
bpa-fragment14,2132,The thousands of tons of steel M_made real communication impossible .
bpa-fragment14,2133,His own radio was M_off .
bpa-fragment14,2134,"Forster settled down , only putting his eye to the slit every M_half minute , not continually as he had started to do ."
bpa-fragment14,2135,He M_had a good view of the long shadowy main corridor .
bpa-fragment14,2136,"The only problem was if ‰ÛÓ he M_corrected himself ‰ÛÓ when it came , which side turning , if any , would it M_use ."
bpa-fragment14,2137,The further away the better .
bpa-fragment14,2138,The more time to see it approach .
bpa-fragment14,2139,The trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room .
bpa-fragment14,2140,"If the approach was M_that way he would M_get no warning at all , and it would be M_on M_top M_of George ‰ÛÓ his name for the M_dummy M_sitting like a M_drunken M_son-of-a-bitch ‰ÛÓ before he knew it ."
bpa-fragment14,2141,"If M_that happened , he 'd have to work fast ."
bpa-fragment14,2142,What he 'd seen done M_to Grant M_made Forster realise that whatever it was struck M_with demonic speed and savagery .
bpa-fragment14,2143,"M_In seconds , M_poor M_old George would be spread around the room like an M_explosion M_in M_Harrod M_'s M_window , and the thing would be away ."
bpa-fragment14,2144,Or M_on him .
bpa-fragment14,2145,"As if M_in protest , George M_uttered a blood-curdling , lunatic-sounding M_cackle , and fell fractionally forward ."
bpa-fragment14,2146,Forster suppressed a M_nervous giggle .
bpa-fragment14,2147,"They M_reached the main deck , dropping down"
bpa-fragment14,2148,"M_in a defensive posture , eyes M_searching the stacked containers , trying to M_probe the black , M_jagged M_recesses between them ."
bpa-fragment14,2149,Lawton scanned upwards .
bpa-fragment14,2150,‰Û÷ It could be anywhere .
bpa-fragment14,2151,Even M_back on the bridge again . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2152,"‰Û÷ We should start in the engine room , ‰Ûª Nell suggested , shivering , ‰Û÷ work M_up through the crew 's quarters , and then into the complex . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2153,"M_Confronted M_with the need to proceed ,"
bpa-fragment14,2154,"Delaney M_took risks , plummeting feet first through the hatchways , and partly M_breaking his descent M_with the handrails , falling like a M_parachutist , rolling instantly deploying his Uzi M_against ‰Û_"
bpa-fragment14,2155,M_Against what ?
bpa-fragment14,2156,"Like Forster , all he could guess was that it was fast ."
bpa-fragment14,2157,"Grant may have been lame , but ‰Û_ fast or silent ?"
bpa-fragment14,2158,Or both ?
bpa-fragment14,2159,The speed of descent must have M_cut M_down the exposure M_to any residual gas since he M_felt none of the earlier weirdness as he approached the still sealed engine room door .
bpa-fragment14,2160,M_Pandora 's M_Box ?
bpa-fragment14,2161,He winced M_at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the M_spy M_port .
bpa-fragment14,2162,"M_In the M_stroboscopic view , the giant pistons were the only things moving ‰ÛÓ until a figure detached itself from the wall , its grey colour exactly M_that of the background steel ."
bpa-fragment14,2163,"Like a M_chameleon , it moved out of the aisle between machines , then stopped , and became utterly motionless ."
bpa-fragment14,2164,Delaney 's stillness M_caught the attention of the others .
bpa-fragment14,2165,Nell 's M_transceivered voice crackled in his headphones .
bpa-fragment14,2166,‰Û÷ What is it ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2167,He did n't want to M_take his eyes M_from it ‰ÛÓ equally he wanted somebody else to see it .
bpa-fragment14,2168,To confirm .
bpa-fragment14,2169,"M_Gently as though he might disturb it , he pulled back ."
bpa-fragment14,2170,‰Û÷ M_Take a look for yourself . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2171,She did ‰ÛÓ and M_caught her breath .
bpa-fragment14,2172,"The creature was large-headed , absurdly so , its body half man , half something M_lost M_in the primordial past ."
bpa-fragment14,2173,But there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was ‰Û_ human .
bpa-fragment14,2174,"Nell knew , and not only because she was a female of the same species ."
bpa-fragment14,2175,She could see in its eyes ‰ÛÓ intelligence .
bpa-fragment14,2176,And human fear .
bpa-fragment14,2177,"But also , as a doctor , she knew exactly what it was ."
bpa-fragment14,2178,"She told Delaney , who shook his head M_with revulsion ."
bpa-fragment14,2179,"Nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions , and paradoxically it was the woman M_in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing M_stand M_in her M_way ."
bpa-fragment14,2180,"George , the sacrificial M_dummy , had n't emitted a squeak for a M_long time ."
bpa-fragment14,2181,Forster scanned the corridor once more .
bpa-fragment14,2182,It was empty .
bpa-fragment14,2183,just as it always had been .
bpa-fragment14,2184,"He sat back again , eyeing the blank wall before him , confident that he 'd catch it , however good it was ."
bpa-fragment14,2185,He kept wondering how it had M_got Silk .
bpa-fragment14,2186,"Silk was the meanest , M_toughest professional he 'd ever known ."
bpa-fragment14,2187,"And yet he 'd disappeared , M_without trace ."
bpa-fragment14,2188,Forster was a fatalist .
bpa-fragment14,2189,He shrugged .
bpa-fragment14,2190,"You could be James Bond , he thought , but if something M_had your M_number M_on it ‰Û_"
bpa-fragment14,2191,"A M_gentle breeze M_broke the absolute silence , moving the curtain so that he had to steady it with his hand ."
bpa-fragment14,2192,"Instantly alert , Forster checked through his M_spy M_port ."
bpa-fragment14,2193,Nothing .
bpa-fragment14,2194,But a door had opened somewhere .
bpa-fragment14,2195,"Somebody , or something , had entered the complex ."
bpa-fragment14,2196,It could be the others returning ‰ÛÓ or the start of his ambush .
bpa-fragment14,2197,‰Û÷ For God 's sake leave your mask on .
bpa-fragment14,2198,And M_that 's an order ! ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2199,But Delaney 's plea was in vain .
bpa-fragment14,2200,"Nell pulled it off , got close to the door , and shouted ."
bpa-fragment14,2201,‰Û÷ We mean you no harm .
bpa-fragment14,2202,You can help us . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2203,"When she checked through the spyhole it was standing in exactly the same M_spot , unmoving , like a M_lizard ."
bpa-fragment14,2204,Lawton shook his head .
bpa-fragment14,2205,‰Û÷ Ca n't hear you .
bpa-fragment14,2206,Try the ship 's system again . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2207,"Nell ran to the wall telephone , and pushed the digit for engine room ."
bpa-fragment14,2208,The small light beneath the M_receiver rests M_showed that the M_line was M_working .
bpa-fragment14,2209,"Worried , Delaney followed , M_searching her face , fearing the tell-tale M_signs of toxicity ."
bpa-fragment14,2210,"M_On impulse , and M_against his better judgment , he pulled off his own mask ."
bpa-fragment14,2211,"Nell repeatedly pressed the button , shouted across M_at Lawton , who was now using the M_spy M_port ."
bpa-fragment14,2212,‰Û÷ What 's happening ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2213,"The M_back of Lawton 's head shook , his M_radio-projected voice crackling ."
bpa-fragment14,2214,‰Û÷ Nothing now .
bpa-fragment14,2215,"The head M_jerked , just the once , to the left , so I M_reckon it heard the ‰Û÷ phone . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2216,"He straightened up and came over , M_directing his question M_at Delaney ."
bpa-fragment14,2217,‰Û÷ We ought to get on . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2218,Delaney nodded his agreement .
bpa-fragment14,2219,"‰Û÷ Leave it , Nell . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2220,His tone was M_sharp .
bpa-fragment14,2221,‰Û÷ It 's not going anywhere . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2222,"She M_squared M_up M_to him , defiantly ,"
bpa-fragment14,2223,"‰Û÷ I ca n't , John ."
bpa-fragment14,2224,Do n't you M_see ?
bpa-fragment14,2225,The M_poor thing is M_part of M_this madness .
bpa-fragment14,2226,"If we can get to it , I can learn so much more ."
bpa-fragment14,2227,"And M_in any case , it might die if we do n't try and help it ‰Û_ soon . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2228,"Delaney M_averted his gaze M_from her , afraid of what he had seen in her eyes ."
bpa-fragment14,2229,‰Û÷ Perhaps it would be better if it did . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2230,"‰Û÷ You do n't mean M_that , ‰Ûª she said , stepping away from him ."
bpa-fragment14,2231,"Delaney M_fiddled awkwardly with his mask , preparatory M_to putting it back on again ."
bpa-fragment14,2232,"‰Û÷ For God 's sake , Nell ."
bpa-fragment14,2233,"All I mean is , we 've M_got a M_job to do ."
bpa-fragment14,2234,And Forster 's M_neck 's M_on the M_line .
bpa-fragment14,2235,Do n't you M_owe it M_to him to come now ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2236,"She M_flushed , but held M_on M_to the ‰Û÷ phone ."
bpa-fragment14,2237,"Obviously striving to be as M_controlled as possible , she smiled ."
bpa-fragment14,2238,"‰Û÷ You two can M_manage , ‰Ûª she said calmly ."
bpa-fragment14,2239,"‰Û÷ I can do better here , M_on my own ."
bpa-fragment14,2240,Quietly .
bpa-fragment14,2241,If I succeed it will M_unlock a M_lot of the mystery of what 's been done M_on Titron .
bpa-fragment14,2242,And ‰Û_ ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2243,She faltered .
bpa-fragment14,2244,‰Û÷ ‰Û_ I think we M_owe it M_to that pathetic creature in there . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2245,‰Û÷ Pathetic ? ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2246,Delaney tried to play down the fear M_in his voice ‰ÛÓ fear for her .
bpa-fragment14,2247,‰Û÷ It might be bloody dangerous .
bpa-fragment14,2248,"Certainly , something on this ship is . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2249,"‰Û÷ Not this one , ‰Ûª Nell said , shaking her head M_with some kind of reassurance ."
bpa-fragment14,2250,‰Û÷ I just know . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2251,Lawton gestured in the gangway .
bpa-fragment14,2252,‰Û÷ You may not be M_at risk M_from what is in here .
bpa-fragment14,2253,What M_about out there ?
bpa-fragment14,2254,There 's no guarantee that what we 're hunting is going to M_follow the M_rules . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2255,Nell shrugged .
bpa-fragment14,2256,‰Û÷ M_That 's a risk I 'll have to M_take .
bpa-fragment14,2257,I 've M_got a more important M_job here . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2258,Delaney knew there was no M_way she would be M_shifted M_from her chosen M_course .
bpa-fragment14,2259,"Ordering her would be ludicrous M_under the changed circumstances , and M_in any event , a M_waste of time ."
bpa-fragment14,2260,But Lawton was right .
bpa-fragment14,2261,"The risk M_from the other danger , or dangers of Titron , frightened him more ."
bpa-fragment14,2262,"‰Û÷ Help me M_secure the stairs behind us , ‰Ûª he M_snapped M_at Lawton , ‰Û÷ as much as we can . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2263,Delaney turned to Nell .
bpa-fragment14,2264,‰Û÷ It might M_buy you the time you need .
bpa-fragment14,2265,But M_take care .
bpa-fragment14,2266,"Do n't be bloody foolish like I am , leaving you here ."
bpa-fragment14,2267,Establish M_contact if you can .
bpa-fragment14,2268,No more M_at M_this M_stage .
bpa-fragment14,2269,Understand ?
bpa-fragment14,2270,And do n't try and get the door open . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2271,But Nell was hardly listening .
bpa-fragment14,2272,"To please him she nodded , then despite Lawton 's presence , squeezed Delaney 's arm ."
bpa-fragment14,2273,‰Û÷ And you . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2274,She smiled .
bpa-fragment14,2275,‰Û÷ Watch out . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2276,"Reluctantly , Delaney M_made for the gangway ."
bpa-fragment14,2277,"Lawton had already shifted some chairs , M_in readiness to form a barricade ."
bpa-fragment14,2278,"He M_gave him a hand M_with a large oil M_drum , and then another , as Nell , M_tearing herself M_from her appointed task , dragged over a bench ."
bpa-fragment14,2279,"As they drew back up the stairs , piling on the pieces she threw up at them , Lawton sniffed ."
bpa-fragment14,2280,‰Û÷ This wo n't M_hold anything .
bpa-fragment14,2281,Just slow it down . ‰Ûª
bpa-fragment14,2282,"Like Forster M_before her , Nell indicated her pistol and grenades ."
bpa-fragment14,2283,"‰Û÷ As long as there 's ti me , that 's all we need . ‰Ûª"
bpa-fragment14,2284,"As they descended the stairs , Delaney paused , and M_took a last look down M_at her ."
bpa-fragment14,2285,"She smiled shyly , then turned away ."
bpa-fragment14,2286,"M_In a sense , as long as he could convince himself that she was safe , he was glad she was n't coming with them ."
bpa-fragment14,2287,"Whatever it was they were M_after , it was an unknown quantity , unknown , that is , except for a lethal ferocity ."
bpa-fragment14,2288,"He pulled on his respirator , his mind M_made M_up to get back to her as soon as he could , for Nell Anderson was all he cared M_about now ."
bpa-fragment14,2289,There it went again .
bpa-fragment14,2290,Forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole .
bpa-fragment14,2291,A sound .
bpa-fragment14,2292,"He could n't M_place it , but it reminded him M_strongly of something ."
bpa-fragment14,2293,The corridor was empty .
bpa-fragment14,2294,It had happened three times now .
bpa-fragment14,2295,"A hissing , We gas M_escaping , ending M_with a M_funny M_little squeak ."
bpa-fragment14,2296,"He looked M_at George , wondering if the sound had M_come from him ."
bpa-fragment14,2297,"Satisfied that everything was as it should be , he checked his watch ."
bpa-fragment14,2298,Well M_over M_half an hour had M_passed .
bpa-fragment14,2299,They ought to be near him soon .
bpa-fragment14,2300,Forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet .
bpa-fragment14,2301,"Quietly he unwrapped the covering paper , then paused , as some instinct M_made him check again ."
bpa-fragment14,2302,"As he did so , the sound M_came nearer ; louder ."
bpa-fragment14,2303,His intense scrutiny M_took M_in the shadowy and empty lengths of the corridor .
bpa-fragment14,2304,"Apart from some M_dark M_patches on the wall that he had n't noticed M_before , there was nothing to see ."
bpa-fragment14,2305,"His gaze M_came M_back M_to George , still sprawled over the control desk ."
bpa-fragment14,2306,"A fly landed on the empty , M_staring vizor , and crawled across it ."
bpa-fragment14,2307,"Forster was sorely tempted to M_nip out and confirm that the noise was M_coming from George by twiddling the volume and tuner , but M_fought M_down the urge ."
bpa-fragment14,2308,"He sat back , pulled off his mask , and M_popped the sweet into his mouth ."
bpa-fragment14,2309,It M_took him only seconds to notice the smell .
bpa-fragment14,2310,Forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him .
bpa-fragment14,2311,"Frightened that it was a gas M_pocket , he fumbled with his mask , and finally got it M_back on ."
bpa-fragment14,2312,His heart was thumping .
bpa-fragment14,2313,"Nothing seemed to be happening , all his senses were apparently functioning normally , except ‰Û_ that the sweet in his mouth seemed permeated M_with the awful smell ; had become a slimy lump of filth ."
bpa-fragment14,2314,He had to get rid of it .
bpa-fragment14,2315,"Forster reached for his mask , just as the M_hissing gas noise sounded right M_on M_top M_of him , ending M_with a M_little shriek ."
bpa-fragment14,2316,He knew then where he 'd heard something similar M_before .
bpa-fragment14,2317,"It was like a man breathing through a respiratory system , with some sort of one-way valve ."
bpa-fragment14,2318,"A shadow M_fell across the wall opposite , as slowly , and fearfully he turned ."
bpa-fragment14,2319,"The curtain was a M_dense , opaque greenish-yellow , and something was right behind it , a shape pressing against the M_humped plastic standing there looking down M_at him , half seen , half imagined ."
bpa-fragment14,2320,"His hand M_went M_out , M_reached for the submachine gun , his fingers M_tightening on the stock ."
bpa-fragment14,2321,"M_With a blood-curdling growl , the curtain was snatched aside ."
bpa-fragment14,2322,"Forster M_half rolled , his Uzi M_trembling in his hand as he M_got M_off M_half a clip M_at point blank M_range ."
bpa-fragment14,2323,But it struck with the speed of an M_attacking M_snake .
bpa-fragment14,2324,"And something else ; something he saw as the curtain tore away and he looked M_into the M_depths of the unbelievable face above him , fractionally dulled his reflexes ."
c8t-fragment01,1,Friday 16 September M_to Tuesday 20 September
c8t-fragment01,2,"Once M_free of the M_knotted M_tentacles of the eastern suburbs , Dalgliesh M_made good time and M_by three he was driving through Lydsett village ."
c8t-fragment01,3,"Here a right turn M_took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a M_golden M_haze of reeds , their M_lumbered M_heads M_straining in the wind ."
c8t-fragment01,4,"And now , for the first time , he thought that he could smell the North Sea , that potent but M_half-illusory tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays , of solitary adolescent walks as he M_struggled M_with his first poems , of his aunt 's tall figure at his side , binoculars round her neck , striding towards the M_haunts of her beloved birds ."
c8t-fragment01,5,"And here , M_barring the road , was the familiar old farm gate still in place ."
c8t-fragment01,6,Its continued presence always M_surprised him since it M_served no purpose that he could M_see except symbolically to M_cut M_off the M_headland and to M_give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue .
c8t-fragment01,7,"It swung open M_at his touch but closing it , as always , was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost M_with a M_familiar sensation of having M_turned his M_back M_on the workaday M_world and entered country which , no matter how frequent his visits , would always be M_alien M_territory ."
c8t-fragment01,8,He was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the North Sea .
c8t-fragment01,9,"The only house to his left was the old Victorian rectory , a square , red-brick building , incongruous behind its M_struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel ."
c8t-fragment01,10,"To his right the ground M_rose M_gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark M_mouth of a concrete M_pillbox , undemolished since the war , and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of M_wave-battered concrete , remnants of the old fortifications which M_lay M_half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach ."
c8t-fragment01,11,"To the north the broken arches and M_stumps of the ruined Benedictine abbey gleamed M_golden in the afternoon sun M_against the M_crinkled blue of the sea and , breasting a small ridge , he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of Larksoken Mill and beyond it , M_against the skyline , the great grey bulk of Larksoken Nuclear power Station ."
c8t-fragment01,12,"The road he was on , M_veering left , would M_lead eventually to the station but was , he knew , seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles M_used the new access road to the north ."
c8t-fragment01,13,"The headland was empty and almost M_bare , the few M_straggling trees , distorted by the wind , M_struggled to M_keep their precarious M_hold in the M_uncompromising soil ."
c8t-fragment01,14,"And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated M_pillbox and it M_struck him that the whole headland had the M_desolate look of an old battlefield , the corpses long since carted away but the air M_vibrating still M_with the gunfire of M_long-lost battles , while the power station loomed over it like a M_grandiose M_modern M_monument M_to the M_unknown M_dead ."
c8t-fragment01,15,M_On his previous visits to Larksoken he had seen Martyr 's Cottage M_spread M_out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill .
c8t-fragment01,16,"But he had never been closer to it than the road and now , driving M_up to it , it M_struck him again that the description ‰Û÷ cottage ‰Ûª was hardly appropriate ."
c8t-fragment01,17,"It was a substantial , two-storey , L-shaped house M_standing to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered , enclosing at the rear a courtyard of York stone which M_gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea ."
c8t-fragment01,18,"No one appeared as he drew up and , before lifting his hand to the bell , he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door ."
c8t-fragment01,19,"In a cottage on M_this site lived Agnes Poley , Protestant martyr , burned at Ipswich , 15th August 1557 , aged 32 years ."
c8t-fragment01,20,"Ecclesiastes chapter 3 , verse 15 ."
c8t-fragment01,21,"The plaque was unadorned , the letters deeply carved M_in an elegant script reminiscent of Eric Gill , and Dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners M_in the late twenties , when the cottage was originally extended ."
c8t-fragment01,22,One of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and M_this was one which it needed no effort of memory to M_recall .
c8t-fragment01,23,"As a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school , he had once been required by the headmaster to write out M_in his best handwriting the M_whole of the third chapter of Ecclesiastes , old Gumboil , economical M_in M_this as M_in all matters , believing that writing M_lines should M_combine punishment M_with literary and religious education ."
c8t-fragment01,24,"The words , M_in M_that round childish script , had M_remained M_with him ."
c8t-fragment01,25,"It was , he thought , an interesting choice of text ."
c8t-fragment01,26,M_That which hath been is now ; and M_that which is to be hath already been ; and God requireth M_that which is past .
c8t-fragment01,27,He rang and there was only a M_short delay before Alice Mair opened the door .
c8t-fragment01,28,"He saw a tall , handsome woman dressed M_with M_careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers ."
c8t-fragment01,29,"He would have recognized her M_from her M_strong resemblance M_to her brother , although she looked the elder M_by some years ."
c8t-fragment01,30,"She M_took it for granted that each knew who the other was , and standing aside to motion him in she said : ‰Û÷ It 's good of you to be so accommodating , Mr Dalgliesh ."
c8t-fragment01,31,I 'm afraid Nora Gurney is implacable .
c8t-fragment01,32,Once she knew you were on your way to Norfolk you were a M_predestined M_victim .
c8t-fragment01,33,Perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,34,"It was a distinguished face with the deep-set , widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows , a well-shaped , rather M_secretive mouth and strong greying hair M_swept upwards and curled M_into a chignon ."
c8t-fragment01,35,"M_In her publicity photographs she could , he M_recalled , look beautiful M_in a somewhat intimidating , M_intellectual and very English M_mould ."
c8t-fragment01,36,"But seen face to face , even M_in the informality of her own house , the absence of a M_spark of sexuality and , he sensed , a deep-seated reserve , M_made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected , and she M_held herself M_stiffly as if M_repelling M_invaders of her personal M_space ."
c8t-fragment01,37,The handshake with which she had greeted him had been M_cool and firm and her M_brief smile was surprisingly attractive .
c8t-fragment01,38,"He knew that he was oversensitive M_to the timbre of the human voice and hers , although not M_jarring or unpleasant , sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking M_at an unnatural pitch ."
c8t-fragment01,39,He followed her M_down the hall to the kitchen at the M_back of the house .
c8t-fragment01,40,"It was , he judged , almost twenty feet long and obviously M_served the triple purpose of sitting room , working place and office ."
c8t-fragment01,41,"The right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an Aga , a butcher 's chopping block , a dresser to the right of the door M_holding an assortment of gleaming pots , and a long working surface with a wooden triangle M_sheathing her assortment of knives ."
c8t-fragment01,42,In the centre of the room was a large wooden table M_holding a stoneware jar of dried flowers .
c8t-fragment01,43,"On the left-hand wall was a M_working fireplace , the two recesses M_fitted with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves ."
c8t-fragment01,44,To each side of the hearth was a M_high-backed wicker armchair M_in an intricate closely woven design M_fitted with patchwork cushions .
c8t-fragment01,45,"There was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and , to its right , a stable door , the top half open , M_gave a view of the paved courtyard ."
c8t-fragment01,46,Dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to M_catch the sun .
c8t-fragment01,47,"The room , which contained nothing superfluous , nothing pretentious , was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and , for a moment , he wondered why ."
c8t-fragment01,48,"Was it the M_faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough , the M_soft ticking of the M_wall-mounted clock which seemed both to M_mark the M_passing seconds and yet to M_hold time M_in thrall , the rhythmic M_moaning of the sea through the half-open door , the sense of M_well-fed ease M_conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs , the open hearth ?"
c8t-fragment01,49,"Or was it that the kitchen reminded Dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had M_found M_warmth and M_undemanding , M_uncensorious companionship , been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats ?"
c8t-fragment01,50,"He placed the proofs on the desk , refused Alice Mair 's offer of coffee and followed her M_back to the front door ."
c8t-fragment01,51,"She walked out with him to the car and said : ‰Û÷ I was sorry M_about your aunt ‰ÛÓ sorry for you , I mean ."
c8t-fragment01,52,I expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to M_go .
c8t-fragment01,53,And to die M_in one 's sleep M_without distress M_to oneself or inconvenience M_to others is an enviable M_end .
c8t-fragment01,54,But you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,55,"M_Formal condolences , he thought , were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere ."
c8t-fragment01,56,Hers had been perceptive .
c8t-fragment01,57,Jane Dalgliesh had indeed seemed M_to him immortal .
c8t-fragment01,58,"The very old , he thought , M_make our past ."
c8t-fragment01,59,Once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we M_have any real existence .
c8t-fragment01,60,He said : ‰Û÷ I do n't think death was ever terrible M_to her .
c8t-fragment01,61,I 'm not sure that I really knew her and I 'm left wishing I 'd tried harder .
c8t-fragment01,62,But I shall miss her . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,63,Alice Mair said : ‰Û÷ I did n't know her either .
c8t-fragment01,64,Perhaps I should have tried harder too .
c8t-fragment01,65,"She was a very private woman , I suspect one of those fortunate people who M_find no other company more agreeable than their own ."
c8t-fragment01,66,It always seems presumptuous to M_encroach M_on that self-sufficiency .
c8t-fragment01,67,Perhaps you M_share it .
c8t-fragment01,68,"But if you can tolerate company , I 'm M_having a few people , mostly colleagues of Alex M_from the power station , M_to dinner M_on Thursday night ."
c8t-fragment01,69,Would you care to join us ?
c8t-fragment01,70,Seven thirty for eight . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,71,"It sounded , he thought , more like a challenge than an invitation ."
c8t-fragment01,72,"Somewhat M_to his surprise , Dalgliesh M_found himself accepting ."
c8t-fragment01,73,But then the M_whole encounter had been a little surprising .
c8t-fragment01,74,She stood regarding him M_with a M_serious intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he M_had the M_impression that she was watching critically to see how he M_handled it .
c8t-fragment01,75,"But at least , he thought as he M_gave a final wave , she had n't asked him whether he had come to Norfolk to help catch the Whistler ."
c8t-fragment01,76,Three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator .
c8t-fragment01,77,"Ahead of him , trudging along on the left of the path , was a little group of children , the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children , one each side of her , clutching the bars ."
c8t-fragment01,78,"Hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a M_peaked , delicate face M_framed with M_red-gold hair ."
c8t-fragment01,79,"He recognized the Blaney children , met once before with their mother walking along the beach ."
c8t-fragment01,80,Obviously the eldest girl had been shopping : the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags .
c8t-fragment01,81,Instinctively he slowed down .
c8t-fragment01,82,"They were unlikely to be M_in real danger , the Whistler stalked M_at night , not M_in M_broad daylight , and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road ."
c8t-fragment01,83,But the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home .
c8t-fragment01,84,Though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it M_lay M_about two miles to the south .
c8t-fragment01,85,"He M_recalled what he knew M_about them , that their father earned a M_precarious living as a painter whose innocuous , prettified watercolours were sold in cafÌ©s and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill M_with cancer ."
c8t-fragment01,86,He wondered whether Mrs Blaney was still alive .
c8t-fragment01,87,"His instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that , he knew , was hardly sensible ."
c8t-fragment01,88,"Almost certainly the eldest child ‰ÛÓ Theresa , was n't it ? ‰ÛÓ had been taught not to accept lifts M_from strangers , particularly men , and he was virtually a stranger ."
c8t-fragment01,89,M_On an M_impulse he reversed the Jaguar and drove quickly M_back to Martyr 's Cottage .
c8t-fragment01,90,M_This time the front door was open and a M_swathe of sunlight M_lay across the red-tiled floor .
c8t-fragment01,91,"Alice Mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen , wiping her hands ."
c8t-fragment01,92,He said : ‰Û÷ The Blaney children are walking home .
c8t-fragment01,93,Theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope M_with the twins .
c8t-fragment01,94,"I thought I could offer a lift if I had a woman with me , someone they know . ‰Ûª"
c8t-fragment01,95,She said briefly : ‰Û÷ They know me . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,96,"M_Without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him , closed the front door after her M_without locking it and got into the car ."
c8t-fragment01,97,"Putting it into gear , his arm M_brushed her knee ."
c8t-fragment01,98,"He was aware of an almost imperceptible M_withdrawing , more emotional than physical , a M_small M_delicate gesture of M_self-containment ."
c8t-fragment01,99,"Dalgliesh doubted whether that M_half-imagined recoil M_had anything to do M_with him personally , nor did he M_find her silence disconcerting ."
c8t-fragment01,100,"Their conversation , when they did speak , was M_brief ."
c8t-fragment01,101,He asked : ‰Û÷ Is Mrs Blaney still alive ? ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,102,‰Û÷ No .
c8t-fragment01,103,She died six weeks ago . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,104,‰Û÷ How are they M_managing ? ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,105,"‰Û÷ Not particularly well , I imagine ."
c8t-fragment01,106,But Ryan Blaney does n't M_welcome M_interference .
c8t-fragment01,107,I sympathize .
c8t-fragment01,108,"Once he M_lets M_down his M_defences M_half the social workers in Norfolk , amateur and professional , will M_move M_in M_on him . ‰Ûª"
c8t-fragment01,109,When they drew up beside the little band it was Alice Mair who opened the car door and spoke .
c8t-fragment01,110,"‰Û÷ Theresa , here is Mr Dalgliesh to M_give you all a lift ."
c8t-fragment01,111,He 's Miss Dalgliesh 's nephew from Larksoken Mill .
c8t-fragment01,112,One of the twins had better sit on my lap .
c8t-fragment01,113,The rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the M_back . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,114,Theresa looked M_at Dalgliesh M_without smiling and said a grave thank you .
c8t-fragment01,115,"She reminded him of pictures of the young Elizabeth Tudor , the same M_red-gold hair M_framing a curiously adult face both M_secretive and self-composed , the same M_sharp nose and M_wary eyes ."
c8t-fragment01,116,"The faces of the twins , M_softer M_editions of her own , M_turned towards her questioningly then M_broke M_into M_shy smiles ."
c8t-fragment01,117,"They looked as if they had been dressed M_in a hurry and not very suitably for a M_long walk on the headland , even M_in a warm autumn ."
c8t-fragment01,118,"One wore a tattered summer dress M_in pink spotted cotton with double flounces , the other a pinafore over a checked blouse ."
c8t-fragment01,119,Their pathetically thin legs were unprotected .
c8t-fragment01,120,Theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of London 's Underground across the front .
c8t-fragment01,121,Dalgliesh M_found himself wondering if it had been brought back M_from a school trip to the capital .
c8t-fragment01,122,It was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms like M_rags M_thrown M_over a M_stick .
c8t-fragment01,123,"M_In M_contrast M_to his sisters , Anthony was M_over-clad , a bundle of leggings , jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead , beneath which he surveyed their busyness , unsmiling , like a M_stout M_imperious M_Caesar ."
c8t-fragment01,124,"Dalgliesh got out of the Jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair , but the M_anatomy of the chair momentarily M_defeated him ."
c8t-fragment01,125,There was a bar beneath which the child 's rigid legs were M_obstinately stuck .
c8t-fragment01,126,The M_solid M_uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy ; it was like M_trying to M_manoeuvre a M_firm and rather M_smelly M_poultice .
c8t-fragment01,127,"Theresa M_gave him a M_brief , pitying smile , dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while , with the other hand , she M_collapsed the pushchair , with a single vigorous shake ."
c8t-fragment01,128,"Dalgliesh took the baby from her while Theresa helped the children into the Jaguar and M_commanded M_with sudden fierceness , ‰Û÷ Sit still . ‰Ûª"
c8t-fragment01,129,"Anthony , recognizing incompetence , grasped Dalgliesh 's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek , so soft that it was like the M_fall of a M_petal ."
c8t-fragment01,130,M_Throughout these manoeuvrings Alice Mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help .
c8t-fragment01,131,It was impossible to know what she was thinking .
c8t-fragment01,132,But once the Jaguar had moved away she turned to Theresa and said M_in a voice of surprising gentleness : ‰Û÷ Does your father know that you 're out alone ? ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,133,‰Û÷ Daddy has taken the van to Mr Sparks .
c8t-fragment01,134,It 's due for its MOT test .
c8t-fragment01,135,Mr Sparks does n't think it 's going to M_pass .
c8t-fragment01,136,And I M_found we 'd M_run M_out of milk for Anthony .
c8t-fragment01,137,We have to have milk .
c8t-fragment01,138,And we wanted some more disposable nappies . ‰Ûª
c8t-fragment01,139,Alice Mair said : ‰Û÷ I 'm M_giving a dinner party M_on Thursday evening .
c8t-fragment01,140,"If your father agrees , would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month ? ‰Ûª"
c8t-fragment01,141,"‰Û÷ What are you going to cook , Miss Mair ? ‰Û÷"
c8t-fragment01,142,‰Û÷ Put your head close so that I can whisper .
c8t-fragment01,143,Mr Dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests .
c8t-fragment01,144,I want it to be a surprise . ‰Û÷
c8t-fragment01,145,The pale M_golden head leaned forward towards the grey and Miss Mair whispered .
c8t-fragment01,146,Theresa smiled and then nodded M_with serious satisfaction M_in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy .
cb5-fragment02,3183,"But M_next morning Ruth awakened early and , leaving Miss Beard M_to her M_gentle dreams , dressed quickly and hurried out of the house ."
cb5-fragment02,3184,It was another M_golden day .
cb5-fragment02,3185,"She still M_retained her English M_habit of M_noting each day 's weather , always expecting changes , marvelling M_at the hot sunny days which M_followed one M_after the other , almost M_with monotony ."
cb5-fragment02,3186,"When she reached the plateau she remained standing , watching for Joss Barnet , waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her ."
cb5-fragment02,3187,There was no longer any need for her to be
cb5-fragment02,3188,‰Û÷ M_discovered ‰Ûª .
cb5-fragment02,3189,Her sole purpose M_in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it .
cb5-fragment02,3190,He was late M_this morning .
cb5-fragment02,3191,Or was she earlier than she thought ?
cb5-fragment02,3192,Had she M_misjudged the time ?
cb5-fragment02,3193,No matter .
cb5-fragment02,3194,"She was happy to wait for him , certain that soon she would see him riding towards her ."
cb5-fragment02,3195,"Then as the minutes M_passed and there was no M_sign of him , she M_considered that perhaps he had overslept ."
cb5-fragment02,3196,It could happen .
cb5-fragment02,3197,"Or had his horse gone lame , cast a shoe ?"
cb5-fragment02,3198,She sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary .
cb5-fragment02,3199,She knew that M_in the M_end he would come .
cb5-fragment02,3200,"M_After a few more minutes she became restless , and stood up again , her eyes M_searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below , M_trying to determine whether some M_small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a M_trick of her imagination ."
cb5-fragment02,3201,Should she set off down the hill to meet him ?
cb5-fragment02,3202,But perhaps he would come by another route and then she would M_miss him .
cb5-fragment02,3203,"M_At the M_end of what she M_reckoned must be an hour , she M_faced the fact that he was not coming ."
cb5-fragment02,3204,"She dropped to the ground again and lay down , M_burying her face in the M_sweet-smelling grass ."
cb5-fragment02,3205,She had been mistaken ever to think that he would come .
cb5-fragment02,3206,"She had M_let her overwhelming desire M_feed her imagination ; had M_read something M_into his words , his looks , his actions , which had not been M_there at all ."
cb5-fragment02,3207,Her face M_burned M_with the shame of it .
cb5-fragment02,3208,"Such was the feeling Joss Barnet had M_aroused M_in her , that not for one moment did it occur M_to her to blame him for anything ."
cb5-fragment02,3209,It was all her M_fault .
cb5-fragment02,3210,"Sick M_at heart , she wept ."
cb5-fragment02,3211,Then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly M_back to the house .
cb5-fragment02,3212,‰Û÷ So you 've decided to M_put M_in an appearance ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3213,Cook said .
cb5-fragment02,3214,‰Û÷ I do seem to M_recall something M_about you offering to help me M_with the party preparations .
cb5-fragment02,3215,But of course if you 've M_changed your mind ‰Û_ ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3216,"‰Û÷ I have n't , ‰Ûª Ruth M_snapped ."
cb5-fragment02,3217,‰Û÷ I 'm ready to start now .
cb5-fragment02,3218,I do n't want any breakfast . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3219,‰Û÷ Hoity-toity !
cb5-fragment02,3220,What 's the M_matter M_with everyone M_this morning ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3221,Cook demanded .
cb5-fragment02,3222,"‰Û÷ There 's Sean O'Farrell and the master left M_in a hurry M_this hour M_past for New York City , both M_without a bite inside them ‰ÛÓ and now you . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3223,‰Û÷ Gone to New York ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3224,‰Û÷ M_That 's what I said . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3225,M_With Mrs Cranbrook 's words Ruth 's appetite immediately M_returned .
cb5-fragment02,3226,So he had not failed her M_after all !
cb5-fragment02,3227,How could she have thought that he would ?
cb5-fragment02,3228,"Something unforeseen and urgent had happened , since Sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon , and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her ."
cb5-fragment02,3229,Relief M_surged M_through her like a M_physical M_infusion of M_new M_blood .
cb5-fragment02,3230,"‰Û÷ I 've M_changed my mind , ‰Ûª she said ."
cb5-fragment02,3231,‰Û÷ I would like some breakfast .
cb5-fragment02,3232,Suddenly I 'm hungry .
cb5-fragment02,3233,When will they be M_back ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3234,‰Û÷ Sean ?
cb5-fragment02,3235,How should I know ?
cb5-fragment02,3236,I do n't understand business .
cb5-fragment02,3237,"What I do understand is that if the master 's not home for the party tomorrow , the mistress wo n't be pleased ‰ÛÓ and M_that 's M_putting it M_mildly ."
cb5-fragment02,3238,"Do n't you dawdle M_over your breakfast then , not if you intend to M_make yourself M_useful ."
cb5-fragment02,3239,There 's plenty to be done . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3240,Ruth worked all M_that day as though she M_had the strength of ten .
cb5-fragment02,3241,"They prepared chicken pies , the pastry as M_light as M_Ruth 's M_heart , turtle soup , a haunch of venison , jellies , blancmanges , syllabubs , trifles , and a M_host of other dishes , M_with still more to be done M_on the day of the party itself ."
cb5-fragment02,3242,Mrs Cranbrook unbent so M_far as to M_show approval .
cb5-fragment02,3243,"‰Û÷ You 've done very well , ‰Ûª she M_conceded ."
cb5-fragment02,3244,"Mrs Carson , knowing how much was involved , had excused Ruth M_from all other duties M_until Anna 's bedtime hour ."
cb5-fragment02,3245,And now it M_approached .
cb5-fragment02,3246,She took off the voluminous apron Cook had lent her and went in search of her M_charge .
cb5-fragment02,3247,Anna was M_in tears .
cb5-fragment02,3248,"‰Û÷ We 're going home , ‰Ûª she sobbed ."
cb5-fragment02,3249,‰Û÷ I do n't want to go back to Mrs Gutermann 's .
cb5-fragment02,3250,I want to stay with Edward .
cb5-fragment02,3251,I want to live with him for ever and ever ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3252,"Ruth could think of few worse fates , but her stomach M_lurched M_at the thought of leaving Millfield ."
cb5-fragment02,3253,‰Û÷ How do you know we 're leaving ? ‰Ûª she asked .
cb5-fragment02,3254,‰Û÷ Who told you ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3255,"‰Û÷ Miss Fitch , ‰Ûª Anna wailed ."
cb5-fragment02,3256,‰Û÷ I do n't like Miss Fitch .
cb5-fragment02,3257,I hate her !
cb5-fragment02,3258,I daresay she wants me to go ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3259,"‰Û÷ Perhaps she 's mistaken , ‰Ûª Ruth said , though she doubted if Miss Fitch was ever wrong ."
cb5-fragment02,3260,‰Û÷ We 'll ask your mama the moment she comes in . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3261,"‰Û÷ I 'm afraid it 's true , ‰Ûª Mrs Carson told them ."
cb5-fragment02,3262,‰Û÷ Of course we were only invited for ten days or so . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3263,Ruth had M_lost count of time .
cb5-fragment02,3264,"M_To her , the M_long summer days had M_stretched M_ahead , M_world M_without M_end ."
cb5-fragment02,3265,"‰Û÷ We are going to leave M_on Sunday , ‰Ûª Mrs Carson M_went M_on ."
cb5-fragment02,3266,"‰Û÷ Not too early M_in the day , since I daresay we shall all be tired M_after tomorrow 's party . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3267,"‰Û÷ Anna tells me she never wants to leave Edward , ‰Ûª Ruth said after the child had M_gone M_to sleep ."
cb5-fragment02,3268,Mrs Carson smiled indulgently .
cb5-fragment02,3269,‰Û÷ Dearest Anna !
cb5-fragment02,3270,"She 's a little young for a holiday infatuation , but we all M_have them sooner or later ."
cb5-fragment02,3271,Thank goodness they never M_last !
cb5-fragment02,3272,"And the more M_intense they are , the M_shorter the duration , so Anna should soon be M_over it . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3273,‰Û÷ Will Mr Barnet be M_back for the party ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3274,Ruth asked .
cb5-fragment02,3275,"‰Û÷ I expect you mean will O'Farrell be M_back , ‰Ûª Mrs Carson said ."
cb5-fragment02,3276,"‰Û÷ And the answer is , I do n't know ."
cb5-fragment02,3277,Mrs Barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him .
cb5-fragment02,3278,It 's a fact that American men seem to M_put business M_before everything .
cb5-fragment02,3279,Thank goodness Englishmen are not like M_that ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3280,"M_Next morning Ruth was M_down in the kitchen early , eagerly hoping to find Sean there ."
cb5-fragment02,3281,"He could well have returned late M_at night and she not heard him , though she had stayed awake for a M_long time , listening for the sound of the horses , the carriage wheels on the drive ."
cb5-fragment02,3282,There was no M_sign of Sean but Mrs Cranbrook was already M_at work .
cb5-fragment02,3283,"‰Û÷ I hope you 're ready to help me , ‰Ûª she said ."
cb5-fragment02,3284,‰Û÷ Everybody is busy M_with M_this and M_that ‰ÛÓ as if food was n't the most important M_thing ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3285,"‰Û÷ I 'll help , Mrs Cranbrook , ‰Ûª Ruth agreed ."
cb5-fragment02,3286,‰Û÷ They 're not M_back then ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3287,She tried to sound nonchalant .
cb5-fragment02,3288,‰Û÷ Not M_back ?
cb5-fragment02,3289,"Oh , you mean O'Farrell and the master ?"
cb5-fragment02,3290,Not that I know of .
cb5-fragment02,3291,There 's no telling when they ‰Û÷ U return .
cb5-fragment02,3292,Sometimes they 're gone for three or four days M_at a time . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3293,‰Û÷ But surely ‰Û_ M_with the party ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3294,Mrs Cranbrook shrugged .
cb5-fragment02,3295,"‰Û÷ He 's a M_law M_unto himself , the master ."
cb5-fragment02,3296,Not for the likes of you and me to question why . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3297,The M_heart had gone out of the day .
cb5-fragment02,3298,"Ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped , praying every moment that Joss Barnet would return before they left Millfield M_next day ."
cb5-fragment02,3299,"But when the day had M_dragged M_to evening ‰ÛÓ in spite of all there was to do the time now M_passed M_slowly ‰ÛÓ and still there was no M_sign of the two men , she began to M_lose hope ."
cb5-fragment02,3300,"M_In the evening , bone-tired , she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant Anna to bed ."
cb5-fragment02,3301,Then she M_turned M_to helping Mrs Carson .
cb5-fragment02,3302,"She brushed her mistress 's hair and piled it on top of her head M_in a M_cluster of curls , carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual ."
cb5-fragment02,3303,It was a style Ruth had devised herself and Mrs Carson was delighted M_with the result .
cb5-fragment02,3304,"‰Û÷ It looks so different , ‰Ûª she said ."
cb5-fragment02,3305,"‰Û÷ You really are quite clever M_at M_this , Ruth ."
cb5-fragment02,3306,And now for my dress . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3307,"She looked beautiful in the yellow satin , the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure , the skirt billowing out ."
cb5-fragment02,3308,But Ruth M_had no M_heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress .
cb5-fragment02,3309,Her M_spirits were M_at their M_lowest M_ebb .
cb5-fragment02,3310,"Mrs Carson M_gave her maid a M_sharp , M_compassionate look ."
cb5-fragment02,3311,She thought she knew the cause of M_this mood and M_in a M_way she was glad to see it .
cb5-fragment02,3312,At least it M_showed that the girl 's mind was M_working M_in the right M_direction .
cb5-fragment02,3313,"‰Û÷ Do n't worry , Ruth , ‰Ûª she said kindly ."
cb5-fragment02,3314,‰Û÷ I dare say O'Farrell will be M_back tomorrow before we leave .
cb5-fragment02,3315,"And if not , there is always New York when the Barnets return M_in the M_fall ."
cb5-fragment02,3316,"And now I sha n't need you again M_this evening , so apart from looking in M_on Anna from time to time , you may do just as you please . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3317,Had she not been so downhearted Ruth would have enjoyed herself .
cb5-fragment02,3318,But she had given up all hope of Joss Barnet returning M_that evening and nothing else M_in the world mattered .
cb5-fragment02,3319,The party M_scene was pretty enough .
cb5-fragment02,3320,Coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond .
cb5-fragment02,3321,"Torchlights , M_flaring M_against the night sky and reflected in the water , had been set up wherever it was suitable ."
cb5-fragment02,3322,Already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear .
cb5-fragment02,3323,Ruth M_had no M_heart for it .
cb5-fragment02,3324,"She climbed the stairs to her room , then undressed and went to bed , wetting the pillow with her tears which , held back all day , now flowed unchecked ."
cb5-fragment02,3325,"Her only comfort was not to have Miss Beard in her room , to be able to suffer M_in solitude ."
cb5-fragment02,3326,"Though she thought sleep would never M_come , eventually it M_did ."
cb5-fragment02,3327,She M_fell asleep M_to the sound of music M_drifting upwards from the drawing-room .
cb5-fragment02,3328,"When she wakened it was still dark , the orchestra still playing , though it was not M_that which had aroused her ."
cb5-fragment02,3329,"M_Penetrating her sleep she had heard the M_faint click of the door latch , and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened ."
cb5-fragment02,3330,"She raised herself on one elbow , blinking her eyes , trying to see M_in the darkness ."
cb5-fragment02,3331,But enough light M_came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there .
cb5-fragment02,3332,It was Joss Barnet .
cb5-fragment02,3333,"M_Shock M_made her cry out , and he closed the door and moved towards her M_in quick strides , putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream ."
cb5-fragment02,3334,"Then he sat on her bed and , M_without a word M_from either of them , she went willingly into his arms and was held close M_in his embrace ."
cb5-fragment02,3335,She felt his heart M_beating M_strong and fast against hers .
cb5-fragment02,3336,"They stayed like M_that for a M_long moment and then he said , ‰Û÷ Light the candle . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3337,"‰Û÷ I ca n't , ‰Ûª she whispered ."
cb5-fragment02,3338,‰Û÷ Someone will see the light under the door . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3339,"‰Û÷ No matter if they do , ‰Ûª he said ."
cb5-fragment02,3340,‰Û÷ They will not think of me here .
cb5-fragment02,3341,Only my coachman knows I am home .
cb5-fragment02,3342,I have not yet M_joined the party . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3343,‰Û÷ You came to me first ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3344,She could hardly believe it .
cb5-fragment02,3345,"He would not tell her , M_this funny M_bewitching little English girl , that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her ."
cb5-fragment02,3346,"She had been M_on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse ; frightened yet defiant , M_sparking M_with anger ."
cb5-fragment02,3347,"Almost , but not quite , she had come M_between him and the work he had had to do in New York City ."
cb5-fragment02,3348,The moment the work was done he had M_ordered his coachman to drive him M_back to Millfield as fast as the horses would go .
cb5-fragment02,3349,"‰Û÷ Light the candle , ‰Ûª he repeated ."
cb5-fragment02,3350,Ruth 's fingers M_trembled as she obeyed him .
cb5-fragment02,3351,Then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time .
cb5-fragment02,3352,"He traced the contours of her face with M_gentle fingers , outlining the curve of her mouth , stroking her temples ."
cb5-fragment02,3353,"M_Without any hurry , in spite of the impatience which had M_brought him here , he caressed the length of her neck and the M_slope of her shoulders ."
cb5-fragment02,3354,"M_From M_out M_of nowhere , Ruth remembered Dick Parker : but not , M_this time , the pleasure of her M_union M_with him , only the M_pain it had M_brought her M_on the Christmas Eve M_following ."
cb5-fragment02,3355,"And now although her whole body M_cried M_out for fulfilment and she longed for Joss Barnet to complete what he had surely come to do , she knew that she must not let it happen ."
cb5-fragment02,3356,"She turned her face away from him , pushed his hand from her ."
cb5-fragment02,3357,‰Û÷ No ! ‰Ûª she cried .
cb5-fragment02,3358,‰Û÷ You must not ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3359,"He M_gave not the M_slightest M_sign of having heard her , continuing to stroke her neck , and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift ."
cb5-fragment02,3360,She tried again to push him away .
cb5-fragment02,3361,‰Û÷ Please !
cb5-fragment02,3362,Please do n't ! ‰Ûª she cried .
cb5-fragment02,3363,It was surprise which M_made him stop for a second .
cb5-fragment02,3364,"He smiled M_at her , an unexpectedly M_tender smile ."
cb5-fragment02,3365,"‰Û÷ I wo n't hurt you , ‰Ûª he said ."
cb5-fragment02,3366,‰Û÷ Do n't be afraid . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3367,‰Û÷ I 'm not afraid of being hurt . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3368,‰Û÷ Then what ‰Û_ ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3369,"‰Û÷ I 'm afraid of afterwards , ‰Ûª she said hesitantly ."
cb5-fragment02,3370,‰Û÷ If I were to M_have a child .
cb5-fragment02,3371,It would be the M_end of the M_world for me . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3372,"‰Û÷ But you wo n't , ‰Ûª he assured her ."
cb5-fragment02,3373,‰Û÷ I 'll M_see M_to M_that .
cb5-fragment02,3374,I 'm not totally callous . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3375,‰Û÷ You promise ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3376,‰Û÷ I promise . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3377,"She lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers , quicker now , M_move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one ."
cb5-fragment02,3378,"And when he had undone her gown , and M_had difficulty M_in lifting it over her head , she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off ."
cb5-fragment02,3379,"Then he pulled down the sheet , which was all the bedclothes she had needed M_on that warm night , and she lay naked before him ."
cb5-fragment02,3380,She observed him M_without shame as he looked at every part of her .
cb5-fragment02,3381,"Her pleasure was M_in him , and M_in his delight of her ."
cb5-fragment02,3382,"When , at last , he M_stripped M_off his clothes and came into her , it was as if M_this was the moment M_to which all her life had been M_leading ."
cb5-fragment02,3383,"He was a skilful lover : tender and gentle M_in the beginning , then powerful , persistent , M_rough almost ‰ÛÓ until , his passion M_rising M_in M_harmony M_with hers , the M_climax M_came like the M_bursting of a M_thousand M_stars , like the M_beginning and M_ending of the M_world ."
cb5-fragment02,3384,"Afterwards they lay quietly side by side , not speaking , until he said , ‰Û÷ I must go . ‰Ûª"
cb5-fragment02,3385,"‰Û÷ Not yet , ‰Ûª she begged ."
cb5-fragment02,3386,‰Û÷ You ca n't leave me yet . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3387,"She turned over and lay on top of him , trying to pin him down M_with her own slight weight , and he began to fondle her and she him , and almost at once they were M_making love again ."
cb5-fragment02,3388,"‰Û÷ You are a M_sorceress , ‰Ûª he told her when it was all M_over ."
cb5-fragment02,3389,‰Û÷ An M_enchantress .
cb5-fragment02,3390,Women as tempting as you should be kept M_out M_of the sight of mortal men . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3391,"‰Û÷ You 're not a mortal man , ‰Ûª Ruth said ."
cb5-fragment02,3392,‰Û÷ You 're a M_god ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3393,He laughed out loud .
cb5-fragment02,3394,‰Û÷ Hush ! ‰Ûª she cautioned .
cb5-fragment02,3395,‰Û÷ Someone will hear you . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3396,"‰Û÷ I 'm a real man all right , ‰Ûª he said ."
cb5-fragment02,3397,‰Û÷ As I 've just proved M_to you .
cb5-fragment02,3398,And would again if time M_allowed . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3399,Then he stood up and quickly began to dress .
cb5-fragment02,3400,‰Û÷ I must go and do my duty as a host for what 's M_left of the night . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3401,"‰Û÷ Do n't leave me , ‰Ûª she begged ."
cb5-fragment02,3402,‰Û÷ Please stay ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3403,"He looked M_at her M_in surprise , spoke brusquely ."
cb5-fragment02,3404,‰Û÷ But of course I must go .
cb5-fragment02,3405,There 's no question . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3406,M_Long afterwards Ruth realised that M_this was the moment when she had learned that she could never M_come first M_with him .
cb5-fragment02,3407,"However much he might desire her , she would M_have no more than the allotted M_space M_in his life ."
cb5-fragment02,3408,‰Û÷ When am I going to see you again ? ‰Ûª she asked .
cb5-fragment02,3409,"That , also , was the wrong M_thing to say ."
cb5-fragment02,3410,"‰Û÷ I ca n't M_make M_plans , ‰Ûª he said sharply ."
cb5-fragment02,3411,‰Û÷ But we leave tomorrow ! ‰Ûª she exclaimed .
cb5-fragment02,3412,M_That M_took him by surprise .
cb5-fragment02,3413,‰Û÷ The M_deuce you do !
cb5-fragment02,3414,Well I shall M_see M_to M_that .
cb5-fragment02,3415,My wife will M_extend the invitation M_to the Carsons .
cb5-fragment02,3416,I M_take it they 're not promised elsewhere ? ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3417,"‰Û÷ Oh no , ‰Ûª Ruth said ."
cb5-fragment02,3418,‰Û÷ We 're going back to New York City . ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3419,"He finished dressing , then came and held her by the shoulders , kissing her lightly on the mouth ."
cb5-fragment02,3420,As he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed .
cb5-fragment02,3421,"‰Û÷ From the city , ‰Ûª he said ."
cb5-fragment02,3422,‰Û÷ You see that I M_had you M_in my mind ! ‰Ûª
cb5-fragment02,3423,"He was out of the room before she could open the box , a M_dark blue leather M_affair , lined M_with white velvet , against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set around the edge with seed pearls ."
cb5-fragment02,3424,She gasped M_in amazement .
cb5-fragment02,3425,"It was M_without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned , or ever would ."
cb5-fragment02,3426,"Such delicacy , such M_refinement !"
cb5-fragment02,3427,"Her fingers M_trembling M_with excitement , she fastened it around her neck ."
cb5-fragment02,3428,It should remain there for ever .
cb5-fragment02,3429,She would never take it off .
ccw-fragment03,1561,Ellen and I lingered on in Mama Sipcott 's for another hour and a M_half ; indulging M_in the sailor 's shorebound pastime of M_planning the perfect voyage .
ccw-fragment03,1562,"We decided that Masquerade would sail from the Bahamas to Panama , and thence to the Galapagos where we would find Darwin 's giant tortoises ."
ccw-fragment03,1563,Then we would sail south to Easter Island to explore the mysterious statues M_before going to the mutineers ' refuge on Pitcairn Island .
ccw-fragment03,1564,"M_After M_that we would go to Tahiti , and I saw the excitement M_grow M_in Ellen as she realised that M_these M_plans were so M_close M_to M_coming true ."
ccw-fragment03,1565,"It was an excitement that M_matched my own , for I had never sailed the South Seas and I had long M_dreamed of M_that M_scatter of tiny , M_magically named islands M_strewn across one third of a globe ."
ccw-fragment03,1566,M_By the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine Ellen and I had long M_reached New Zealand and were already sailing north towards New Caledonia .
ccw-fragment03,1567,We were happy .
ccw-fragment03,1568,We M_caught the bus M_back to Ellen 's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks .
ccw-fragment03,1569,She was moving M_back on board Wavebreaker M_in preparation for the M_next day 's early departure .
ccw-fragment03,1570,"I carried her luggage to the yard , M_noting that even Ellen 's M_strident feminism M_evaporated M_in the M_face of two heavy bags and tropical heat ."
ccw-fragment03,1571,"Once in the boatyard Ellen ran ahead of me , evidently eager to reach Wavebreaker 's air conditioning ."
ccw-fragment03,1572,"Then , as she reached the dock 's edge , she suddenly checked ."
ccw-fragment03,1573,‰Û÷ What on earth is that ?
ccw-fragment03,1574,"Oh , no ! ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1575,She began to run again .
ccw-fragment03,1576,When I reached the water 's edge I understood her dismay .
ccw-fragment03,1577,"A large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside Wavebreaker , but moored so M_crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders , but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in Wavebreaker 's white paint ."
ccw-fragment03,1578,Yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them .
ccw-fragment03,1579,"There was nothing wrong M_with the boat 's lines , which were M_sleekly functional , but M_her long M_powerful hull , M_her upperworks , and even the interior of M_her capacious working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint ."
ccw-fragment03,1580,"The seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue , black , silver , green and white had been designed to M_disguise a boat 's shape M_from the M_prying eyes of U-Boat captains , so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the Bahamas ."
ccw-fragment03,1581,"M_This boat was M_called Dream M_Baby , and M_she was clearly an expensive M_infant for rods and M_whip-aerials and outriggers M_splayed from M_her upperworks like the M_antennae of some M_outlandish M_insect ."
ccw-fragment03,1582,"M_She M_boasted a harpoon walkway , a M_flybridge , and , above the highest wheel-platform , an aluminium M_canopy which M_held a radar aerial ."
ccw-fragment03,1583,"The fighting chair on M_her aft deck M_had thick white leather straps M_giving it the appearance of a M_padded M_electric M_chair , while the dazzle paint M_gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on M_her M_bows in silver-edged black numerals like M_those warships M_use to display their commissioning numbers ."
ccw-fragment03,1584,The boat 's M_wrap-around windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only M_added M_to Dream Baby 's M_ugly M_air of menace .
ccw-fragment03,1585,"Ellen , unencumbered M_with luggage , had already reached Wavebreaker and taken two plastic fenders from a locker ."
ccw-fragment03,1586,She swung lithely down to Dream Baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls .
ccw-fragment03,1587,‰Û÷ How bad is the damage ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1588,I called down M_to her when I reached Wavebreaker .
ccw-fragment03,1589,‰Û÷ It 's scraped M_back to M_bare metal ! ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1590,‰Û÷ I 'll M_give it some paint . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1591,"Wavebreaker 's hull was made of steel and , while such hulls are marvellously M_strong and safe , they are soon M_weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air ."
ccw-fragment03,1592,I had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to M_bite M_into Wavebreaker 's long M_sleekness .
ccw-fragment03,1593,Ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat .
ccw-fragment03,1594,‰Û÷ You 'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1595,‰Û÷ Who cares ?
ccw-fragment03,1596,"Just cut the damn boat loose , ‰Ûª I said vengefully ."
ccw-fragment03,1597,"Ellen ignored my advice while I , obedient M_to the M_rule that if a job needed doing then do it M_without delay , found a pot of white paint and M_dug through the locker for a clean brush ."
ccw-fragment03,1598,"Then , from behind me , an unfamiliar voice sounded : ‰Û÷ Oh , M_ring my M_bells . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1599,It was a man 's voice ; drawling and M_lazy .
ccw-fragment03,1600,"I twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun , but then , M_through the dizzying glare , I made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed , incongruously , to be dressed in a long , transparent dressing gown ."
ccw-fragment03,1601,"He was emerging M_in stately fashion from Wavebreaker 's M_companionway and , though I could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair , I could make out no details of his face ."
ccw-fragment03,1602,‰Û÷ Who the M_hell are you ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1603,I demanded .
ccw-fragment03,1604,"The man ignored me , walking instead towards Ellen who , dressed only in shorts and T-shirt , was climbing long-legged over Wavebreaker 's rail ."
ccw-fragment03,1605,"‰Û÷ Be M_still my M_restless heart , ‰Ûª the man had a M_strong , M_caressing voice and the M_slow M_luscious accent of America 's M_deep south ."
ccw-fragment03,1606,"‰Û÷ Dear lady , dear lady , to think that I might have lived my M_whole life M_through and never seen you ."
ccw-fragment03,1607,"Oh , lay me down , just lay me down . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1608,"Ellen , usually so quick M_with a scornful reply , just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her , took her hand , then bowed above her fingers ."
ccw-fragment03,1609,"He kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles , then closed his eyes ."
ccw-fragment03,1610,"‰Û÷ Dear sweet M_Lord above , I do thank Thee for Thy kindness M_in showing me this lovely woman before I died . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1611,M_To my astonishment and chagrin Ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled M_at her .
ccw-fragment03,1612,"‰Û÷ My name , ‰Ûª he M_stroked her M_with his voice , ‰Û÷ is Jesse Isambard Sweetman ."
ccw-fragment03,1613,"And who , dear creature , are you ? ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1614,Ellen still said nothing .
ccw-fragment03,1615,"I had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and I could see Sweetman properly , and what I saw I did not like ."
ccw-fragment03,1616,"His face was M_old and M_young , sardonic and knowing , M_amused and handsome ; the face of a man who has seen the world 's M_wickedness and knows how to M_match it M_with his own ."
ccw-fragment03,1617,"His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon , his skin was M_parchment pale , and his eyes M_dark ."
ccw-fragment03,1618,"I M_put his age M_at forty , but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome , and he knew it , for his expression M_showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold Ellen 's hand , and he M_showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what M_liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away ."
ccw-fragment03,1619,"Thus released , Jesse Sweetman turned to look at me ."
ccw-fragment03,1620,"The dressing gown had proved to be a long , stylish , ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton ."
ccw-fragment03,1621,Beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots .
ccw-fragment03,1622,"It was a M_dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind I only expected to see on the male M_models who posed M_in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard Wavebreaker , yet Jesse Isambard Sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style M_with an M_elegant insouciance ."
ccw-fragment03,1623,"The only incongruous M_note was a cheap round badge , enamelled M_in red and yellow , that he wore on his shirt , which M_bore the legend ‰Û÷ Just Say No ! ‰Ûª ."
ccw-fragment03,1624,"‰Û÷ You must be Nicholas Breakspear , ‰Ûª he said carelessly , as though he did not much care whether I was or not ."
ccw-fragment03,1625,‰Û÷ Is that gaudy piece of junk your boat ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1626,I gestured to where Dream Baby 's aerials showed above Wavebreaker 's gunwale .
ccw-fragment03,1627,Sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time .
ccw-fragment03,1628,"‰Û÷ No , ‰Ûª he said helpfully , then M_bestowed a patronising smile M_on me ."
ccw-fragment03,1629,‰Û÷ You look so like your father .
ccw-fragment03,1630,It 's really uncanny . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1631,‰Û÷ Did you bring that boat here ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1632,I persevered .
ccw-fragment03,1633,"‰Û÷ Oh , indeed I did , ‰Ûª he said M_brightly , as though he merely indulged a rather M_dim child 's curiosity ."
ccw-fragment03,1634,"‰Û÷ Your mother was Malise Fielding , am I right ?"
ccw-fragment03,1635,Or are you Lucy de Sills ‰Ûª son ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1636,‰Û÷ Why the M_hell did n't you use fenders when you tied alongside ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1637,"He sighed , intimating what a bore I was being ."
ccw-fragment03,1638,"‰Û÷ I did not use fenders , Breakspear , because I despise precautions ."
ccw-fragment03,1639,Precautions are the M_symptoms of M_small and M_fearful minds .
ccw-fragment03,1640,"Precautions will not M_conquer empires , they will not M_build great cities , they will not M_transmute dreams M_into gold or M_carry men across wide oceans , and precautions will not , emphatically not , M_win fair ladies , ‰Ûª and here he turned to Ellen and lasciviously M_dropped his gaze to her long bare legs ."
ccw-fragment03,1641,"Ellen twisted away and Sweetman laughed M_at her obvious discomfiture , then , as coolly as though he owned Wavebreaker , he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first M_brushed at , then sat on , one of the white cushioned seats by the ship 's wheel ."
ccw-fragment03,1642,"‰Û÷ I 've M_had a look round the boat , ‰Ûª he said very coolly , ‰Û÷ and I approve of M_her ."
ccw-fragment03,1643,So tell me the cost of a week 's charter . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1644,"‰Û÷ The man you want to see , ‰Ûª I said , ‰Û÷ is called Matthew McIllvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase ."
ccw-fragment03,1645,"He 's not here M_this afternoon , but you can doubtless telephone him M_next week . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1646,Sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on M_before inspecting me again .
ccw-fragment03,1647,He did not seem to like what he saw .
ccw-fragment03,1648,"‰Û÷ You 're really not being noticeably helpful , ‰Ûª he said M_after a pause , ‰Û÷ so let us try again shall we ?"
ccw-fragment03,1649,Would you please tell me the M_high season price for one week ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1650,‰Û÷ How many passengers ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1651,Ellen asked before I could refuse to answer .
ccw-fragment03,1652,"Sweetman paused again , M_this time to light a long M_pale blue cigarette with a M_slim gold lighter ."
ccw-fragment03,1653,He shrugged .
ccw-fragment03,1654,"‰Û÷ Two , four , six passengers ?"
ccw-fragment03,1655,Does it really matter ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1656,"‰Û÷ One week M_in M_high season costs ten thousand US dollars for two people , and every extra couple is another thousand bucks . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1657,"Ellen 's voice was M_cold , as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity ."
ccw-fragment03,1658,‰Û÷ And M_to M_those prices you have to M_add the boat 's running costs . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1659,‰Û÷ Which are ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1660,Sweetman asked carelessly .
ccw-fragment03,1661,‰Û÷ A M_lot . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1662,Ellen said flatly .
ccw-fragment03,1663,"‰Û÷ You 're talking fuel , food and liquor , plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment , snorkels , jet-skis or sailboards . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1664,"Sweetman M_drew on his fancy cigarette , then blew a M_plume of smoke into Wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily M_at Ellen ."
ccw-fragment03,1665,"‰Û÷ And tell me , M_sweet creature , do you M_count as a M_toy ?"
ccw-fragment03,1666,Or are you a M_part of the initial ten thousand dollars ? ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1667,"‰Û÷ Get off the boat , ‰Ûª I said ."
ccw-fragment03,1668,‰Û÷ Shut up . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1669,He M_turned M_on me like a M_snake .
ccw-fragment03,1670,"‰Û÷ You 're nothing but a hired hand , Breakspear , so shut the fuck up . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1671,He glanced at the paint pot and brush that I was still holding .
ccw-fragment03,1672,‰Û÷ Go and paint something .
ccw-fragment03,1673,Be useful . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1674,"He stared M_into my eyes , challenging me to defy him , and when I did not move he looked M_back to Ellen ."
ccw-fragment03,1675,"‰Û÷ I asked you a question , dear M_heart ."
ccw-fragment03,1676,Please be so good as to answer . ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1677,"‰Û÷ Get off this boat , ‰Ûª I told him , but my anger only amused Sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart ."
ccw-fragment03,1678,"‰Û÷ Dick off , ‰Ûª he said M_to me ."
ccw-fragment03,1679,I was surprised that he so eagerly sought to M_confront me .
ccw-fragment03,1680,"I am not a small man , nor am I a weakling , yet the thin Sweetman seemed unconcerned as I jumped down into the M_cockpit ."
ccw-fragment03,1681,Then I saw why he was so confident .
ccw-fragment03,1682,He put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face .
ccw-fragment03,1683,"‰Û÷ A ladies ‰Ûª gun , ‰Ûª he said , ‰Û÷ but remarkably effective at close range . ‰Ûª"
ccw-fragment03,1684,‰Û÷ Nick ! ‰Ûª
ccw-fragment03,1685,"Ellen called warningly , as though I might not have seen the gun ."
ccw-fragment03,1686,The gun 's M_threat had not stopped my advance .
ccw-fragment03,1687,"I was M_calling Sweetman 's bluff , confident he would not dare pull the trigger , and equally confident that my marine training would let me M_turn him M_into M_mincemeat ."
ccw-fragment03,1688,"I was also half drunk , and thus M_filled M_with the Dutch courage M_offered by Mama Sipcott 's worst white wine ."
ccw-fragment03,1689,Sweetman stood .
ccw-fragment03,1690,"There was , at last , a look of alarm on his face , and I could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger ."
ccw-fragment03,1691,He held the gun pointed at my eyes .
cdb-fragment02,355,"The picture , very like the one Rufus Fletcher had M_taken M_in the summer of 1976 , M_occupied the screen for M_about fifteen seconds ."
cdb-fragment02,356,The M_whole item was M_allowed no more than four times M_that M_in the BBC 's Sunday evening news broadcast M_at 6.30 .
cdb-fragment02,357,The other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking M_to a reporter M_about M_having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest .
cdb-fragment02,358,But Shiva and Lili Manjusri saw the picture and so did Rufus Fletcher .
cdb-fragment02,359,"Adam Verne-Smith , M_unwinding in Puerto de la Cruz , did not of course see it ."
cdb-fragment02,360,He did not even see an English newspaper .
cdb-fragment02,361,They were expensive to buy and M_came a day late .
cdb-fragment02,362,"He did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the International Herald Tribune , a copy of which Anne found on the beach ."
cdb-fragment02,363,"His father , at home in Edgware , said M_to his wife :"
cdb-fragment02,364,"‰Û÷ Good God , Wyvis Hall , as I live and breathe . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,365,"Beryl Verne-Smith peered , but the picture immediately vanished ."
cdb-fragment02,366,"‰Û÷ Yes , I suppose it was . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,367,"The policeman talked , the reporter trying to M_jog him M_into revelations and failing ."
cdb-fragment02,368,"In the background , autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill ."
cdb-fragment02,369,"Lewis Verne-Smith sat shaking his head , less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair M_at the state of the world ."
cdb-fragment02,370,"It was not that unpleasant memories were evoked , for M_these were always M_with him , his existence was inseparable M_from M_that old M_bitterness , but that a sight of the house , even the glimpse of a photograph , M_revived the precise feelings he had M_had ‰ÛÓ why , it must be getting on for eleven years ago ."
cdb-fragment02,371,"‰Û÷ Ten and a half , ‰Ûª said his wife ."
cdb-fragment02,372,‰Û÷ I shall have to get in touch with the police .
cdb-fragment02,373,"No two M_ways M_about it , I shall have to get in touch with them . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,374,"‰Û÷ Not M_this evening , surely ? ‰Ûª said Beryl , who wanted to watch Mastermind ."
cdb-fragment02,375,Lewis said nothing .
cdb-fragment02,376,The room in which they were sitting M_underwent the M_curious M_shrinking process M_to which it was M_subject whenever he was reminded of Wyvis Hall or his Uncle Hilbert or even if the county of Suffolk were mentioned .
cdb-fragment02,377,Suddenly it grew small and poky .
cdb-fragment02,378,"The brick side-wall of his neighbour 's house seemed to have M_moved itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence , so that it loomed offensively ."
cdb-fragment02,379,Lewis got up and pulled the curtains across M_with a M_pettish jerk of his hands .
cdb-fragment02,380,‰Û÷ Should n't you wait until Adam gets back ? ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,381,Beryl said .
cdb-fragment02,382,‰Û÷ Why ?
cdb-fragment02,383,What would M_that be in aid of ? ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,384,"Beryl meant that Adam had been M_among the previous owners of Wyvis Hall while her husband had not , but she knew better than to M_point M_this M_out ."
cdb-fragment02,385,‰Û÷ There is no one living knows M_that lovely place better than 1 . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,386,‰Û÷ M_That 's M_true . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,387,"‰Û÷ I sha n't wait till Adam returns , ‰Ûª Lewis said M_in M_that manner that had once M_led his daughter to call him the M_Frog M_Footman ,"
cdb-fragment02,388,‰Û÷ but I shall wait M_until tomorrow . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,389,"Men and women do not usually M_put their baser M_feelings and intentions M_into words , not even M_in the M_deep M_recesses of their own minds ."
cdb-fragment02,390,"So Lewis did not say , even M_to himself , when he was M_privately M_considering trying to M_get M_hold of his son in Tenerife , that he disliked Adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday ."
cdb-fragment02,391,"Instead , he rationalized his thoughts and M_justified himself Adam probably ‰ÛÓ indeed , almost certainly ‰ÛÓ knew nothing M_about the find in the pine wood , but Adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility ."
cdb-fragment02,392,He could not M_shed M_that responsibility just because he had sold the place .
cdb-fragment02,393,Lewis would have agreed M_with Oscar Wilde that our past is what we are .
cdb-fragment02,394,We can not rid ourselves of it .
cdb-fragment02,395,"Therefore it was Adam 's duty to come home and M_face the M_music , even though M_this might be no more than a M_short M_blast M_on a M_tin M_whistle ."
cdb-fragment02,396,But he M_had no precise idea where Adam was and he did not think Adam 's travel agent ( a personal friend of the young Verne-Smiths ) would tell him .
cdb-fragment02,397,Some excuse would be M_made for not telling him .
cdb-fragment02,398,"Lewis 's M_bark , anyway , was always worse than his M_bite ."
cdb-fragment02,399,"He M_had virtually no M_bite , as he had once overheard Adam say M_to Bridget , and heard it M_with M_helpless chagrin ."
cdb-fragment02,400,‰Û÷ A M_bloody good M_thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,401,Lewis walked into his local police station in Edgware M_on Monday morning .
cdb-fragment02,402,They seemed surprised to see him but not astonished .
cdb-fragment02,403,The Suffolk police had begun M_hunting M_up previous owners of Wyvis Hall and they had been alerted that a Verne-Smith lived in their area .
cdb-fragment02,404,"There were , M_after all , only two M_in the London phone directory ."
cdb-fragment02,405,M_This might be a bonus .
cdb-fragment02,406,He was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant M_prepared to M_take a statement M_from him .
cdb-fragment02,407,M_With M_busy pomposity Lewis dictated it M_to a typist and would have M_gone M_on and M_on had he not been diplomatically M_restrained .
cdb-fragment02,408,"‰Û÷ Wyvis Hall , Nunes , Suffolk , and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property , M_through his marriage , of my uncle , Hilbert Verne-Smith ."
cdb-fragment02,409,"They M_came M_into the possession of my son Hilbert John Adam Verne-Smith M_under my uncle 's will , M_bypassing myself , though my son was no more than nineteen M_at the time of my uncle 's death ."
cdb-fragment02,410,"Being an undergraduate M_at the time , my son naturally never M_considered actually residing in the house ."
cdb-fragment02,411,"He was M_in agreement M_with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college M_in the autumn of 1976 , he M_took my advice and M_placed house and lands M_in the M_hands of an estate agent ."
cdb-fragment02,412,‰Û÷ Country properties were not selling well M_at the time .
cdb-fragment02,413,"å£45,000 was the asking price and I was not surprised that the sale , so to speak , M_hung M_fire ."
cdb-fragment02,414,"However , M_in the spring of 1977 an offer was M_made , which my son accepted ."
cdb-fragment02,415,"M_This sale later fell through and it was not M_until the M_following August that Wyvis Hall was finally sold M_to a Mr and Mrs Langan for the much improved figure of å£51,995 ."
cdb-fragment02,416,"‰Û÷ As M_far as I know , my son 's personal acquaintance M_with Wyvis Hall was M_confined M_to my uncle 's lifetime when 1 , my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him ."
cdb-fragment02,417,"M_After my uncle 's death M_in April 1976 he visited Wyvis Hall M_on perhaps two , or M_at the most three , M_separate occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and M_reaching a decision M_about the disposal of furniture and effects ."
cdb-fragment02,418,‰Û÷ I suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants M_took possession of the house M_between the time of my uncle 's death and the sale of the property .
cdb-fragment02,419,Certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it M_on either a temporary or permanent basis .
cdb-fragment02,420,‰Û÷ My son is at present M_on holiday in Tenerife with his wife and daughter .
cdb-fragment02,421,"I can not say precisely when I expect him to return , though I should suppose M_in M_about a week M_from now . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,422,It was all very M_small and M_quiet and low-key .
cdb-fragment02,423,The snippet M_in Rufus 's Monday morning newspaper M_measured just an M_inch M_in M_depth .
cdb-fragment02,424,It M_answered the question he had asked himself and M_told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as M_those of a young woman.
cdb-fragment02,424a,M_This was not a M_shock .
cdb-fragment02,425,"How could it be otherwise , since M_this was Wyvis Hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery ?"
cdb-fragment02,426,"To photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself , on the edge of the lawn M_with his back to the cedar tree ."
cdb-fragment02,427,A popular .
cdb-fragment02,428,"mass-produced camera he had used , but quite a good one ."
cdb-fragment02,429,"One M_thing M_about Zosie 's pilfering , she never stole M_rubbish ."
cdb-fragment02,430,He had M_taken a picture of her M_after M_that and one of the animal cemetery .
cdb-fragment02,431,‰Û÷ Why is the grass always so short M_up here ? ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,432,Adam had asked .
cdb-fragment02,433,"‰Û÷ Rabbits , I expect . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,434,‰Û÷ Why ca n't M_bloody rabbits come and eat my lawns ? ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,435,"Adam always referred M_to ‰Û÷ my lawns ‰Ûª , ‰Û÷ my house ‰Ûª , ‰Û÷ my furniture ‰Ûª ."
cdb-fragment02,436,"It had M_got M_up Rufus 's M_nose a bit , though Adam M_had a perfect right to do M_this ."
cdb-fragment02,437,"It was his , all of it , and it M_went M_to his M_head rather ."
cdb-fragment02,438,"Nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions , M_after all ."
cdb-fragment02,439,"It must have been some time M_in August when I M_took M_those pictures , Rufus thought , and a M_couple of weeks later it was all M_over ."
cdb-fragment02,440,"Coincidentally , as the community and their lives together M_broke M_up , M_so M_did the weather ."
cdb-fragment02,441,"It was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery , the pines M_bowing and M_shivering in the wind ."
cdb-fragment02,442,Sometimes they had had to stop and M_take shelter under the closely planted-trees .
cdb-fragment02,443,If the weather had M_held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper ?
cdb-fragment02,444,Probably not .
cdb-fragment02,445,"In spite of the rain , the earth was still as hard as M_iron ."
cdb-fragment02,446,"A M_sheet of rain had come down then , a M_hard , gusty M_shower , while they were laying the squares of turf M_back in place , and Adam had said something M_about the rain M_making the grass grow quickly , the rain being M_on their M_side ."
cdb-fragment02,447,"‰Û÷ We should all go our M_separate ways as soon as we can , ‰Ûª Rufus had said ."
cdb-fragment02,448,‰Û÷ We should pack up now and go . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,449,The spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables .
cdb-fragment02,450,They had packed and Adam had locked up the house .
cdb-fragment02,451,M_At some M_point Rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it .
cdb-fragment02,452,Adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not M_wrench himself away .
cdb-fragment02,453,So much of its beauty had been M_stripped M_from it by the M_whipping winds .
cdb-fragment02,454,And by the M_neglect of the M_long hot summer .
cdb-fragment02,455,A sudden gust of rain M_dashed against the red bricks that were already stained M_in patches by water .
cdb-fragment02,456,"The house that when he first saw it had seemed to M_float M_on a M_raft of M_golden M_mist , now M_lay in a wilderness , amidst M_ragged grass and M_straggling bushes and trees dead M_from the heat ."
cdb-fragment02,457,"M_Dirty grey clouds M_tumbled across the sky above the slate roof , now the only thing that M_shone , M_glazed with rain ."
cdb-fragment02,458,But Rufus M_admitted M_to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never M_meant much M_to him .
cdb-fragment02,459,It was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked .
cdb-fragment02,460,And now he longed only to get away .
cdb-fragment02,461,"They all got into Goblander and he drove away M_up the drift , Adam next to him , the others in the M_back ."
cdb-fragment02,462,The drift had become a M_tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van .
cdb-fragment02,463,None of them M_allowed their eyes to M_turn towards the pine wood .
cdb-fragment02,464,"At the top they came out into M_uncompromising , bright grey light , the bleak , hedgeless lane , the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees M_squatted like M_old M_men M_in M_cloaks ."
cdb-fragment02,465,"Adam 's simile , not his , thought Rufus M_with a grimace ."
cdb-fragment02,466,No one asked where he was taking them .
cdb-fragment02,467,No one spoke .
cdb-fragment02,468,Adam had Hilbert 's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and Rufus guessed the gun was inside it .
cdb-fragment02,469,They must have gone a good two miles before they M_met another car .
cdb-fragment02,470,Rufus overtook a bus M_going to Colchester and M_dropped the two in the M_back so that they could M_catch it .
cdb-fragment02,471,He took Adam on to Sudbury for him to M_catch a train there and M_at M_that M_point they parted .
cdb-fragment02,472,"Adam got down from Goblander and said ,"
cdb-fragment02,473,"‰Û÷ For ever and for ever , farewell , Rufus . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,474,"Which was probably a quotation M_from something , though Rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was M_in bad M_taste , histrionic , though just like Adam ."
cdb-fragment02,475,"‰Û÷ M_Take care , ‰Ûª said Rufus , and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery , drove off round the town he had got to know so well , over the Stour bridge , into Essex , heading for Halstead and Dunmow and Ongar and London ."
cdb-fragment02,476,He never had seen any of them again .
cdb-fragment02,477,"There had been no need to pretend , to turn aside ."
cdb-fragment02,478,"Briefly , starting his fifth year M_in medical school something M_over thirteen months later , he had wondered if Shiva Manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen ."
cdb-fragment02,479,"But no , his intuition had been M_accurate ."
cdb-fragment02,480,M_At any M_rate Shiva 's face was not among the several brown faces .
cdb-fragment02,481,"As for the others , avoiding them had M_presented no problems ."
cdb-fragment02,482,Would they get in touch with him now ?
cdb-fragment02,483,No contingency M_plans had been M_made for M_this eventuality .
cdb-fragment02,484,So long as there was no M_hunt for a missing girl they had M_felt themselves reasonably M_safe .
cdb-fragment02,485,Their minds had not M_reached M_out M_to the terror of what had M_in fact happened .
cdb-fragment02,486,None of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined M_devotion M_to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites .
cdb-fragment02,487,It was Shiva who had proposed the site .
cdb-fragment02,488,They had congratulated him M_on his ingenuity .
cdb-fragment02,489,Ten years ‰Û_
cdb-fragment02,490,"An ovarian cyst , nothing to get M_upset M_about , Rufus told Ms Beauchamp ."
cdb-fragment02,491,"She was thirty-two , an editor M_with a distinguished publishing house , married M_to an investigative journalist ."
cdb-fragment02,492,"As yet they M_had no children , but she wanted four , she told Rufus ."
cdb-fragment02,493,‰Û÷ No reason why you should n't . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment02,494,He M_had another glance at her notes .
cdb-fragment02,495,"‰Û÷ M_In fact , a peculiarity M_about M_this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs M_in a woman who 's M_had a baby . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,496,"‰Û÷ My God , ‰Ûª she said , putting her coat on , ."
cdb-fragment02,497,"'and there was 1 , M_making my husband 's life a misery , sure I 'd M_got the dreaded C. ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment02,498,"They all thought they 'd M_got the dreaded C , M_poor M_things ."
cdb-fragment02,499,You could n't blame them .
cdb-fragment02,500,"Rufus took her å£40 off her by the reception desk , having M_set M_in M_train the arrangements by which she would be M_admitted M_to a fashionable West End clinic , M_with Rufus , her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association M_to which she and her husband subscribed ."
cdb-fragment02,501,Rufus shook hands .
cdb-fragment02,502,"He walked M_back to his consulting room , M_dying for a cigarette ."
cdb-fragment02,503,M_This was unlike him .
cdb-fragment02,504,He could usually M_get M_through quite easily M_until M_after lunch .
cdb-fragment02,505,"He thought , I know what my idea of heaven would be , if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to M_pass eternity : a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke M_without impairment of breathing , destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart , light each M_fresh cigarette from the glowing M_butt of its M_predecessor , and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka M_laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened Perrier endlessly , M_with increasing euphoria until a M_peak of joy and ease was M_reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion ‰Û_"
cdb-fragment02,506,"Sitting alone , he lit his cigarette , the first of the day , and there M_came M_that M_faint M_swimming M_in the head , a tautening of the gut ."
cdb-fragment02,507,He closed his eyes .
cdb-fragment02,508,"If it M_comes M_to M_light that I was in M_that house with Adam and the others , he thought M_with M_cold M_clarity , if someone M_tells the papers , or the police and thence the papers , that I was there during the summer of 1976 , living there , it will be all M_up M_with me ."
cdb-fragment02,509,"I will M_lose my practice and my reputation and everything that I M_have and can M_look M_forward M_to , if not my liberty ."
cdb-fragment02,510,And M_without the rest I sha n't care M_about my liberty .
cdb-fragment02,511,"It would be bad enough if I were a G P or an expert M_in some other M_branch of medicine , an orthopaedic surgeon , for instance , or an ear , nose and throat man , but I am a gynaecologist , and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there ‰Û_"
cdb-fragment02,512,What worried woman would come to me ?
cdb-fragment02,513,What Mrs Strawson or Ms Beauchamp ?
cdb-fragment02,514,What GP would send her to me ?
cdb-fragment02,515,"If I were innocent , thought Rufus , I know very well what I would do ."
cdb-fragment02,516,I would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and M_get his advice .
cdb-fragment02,517,He might advise me to M_make a statement M_to the police which I should of course do M_under his M_guidance .
cdb-fragment02,518,But I shall not do M_this because I am not innocent .
cdb-fragment02,519,"I shall sit here and wait and M_sweat it M_out and M_look the facts M_in the M_face , trying to anticipate the worst that can happen ."
cdb-fragment04,855,"The wonderful M_thing M_about the human mind , Adam thought , is the M_way it M_copes when the worst happens ."
cdb-fragment04,856,"M_Beyond M_that worst happening you think there can be nothing , the unimaginable has M_taken M_place , and M_on the other M_side is death , destruction , the M_end ."
cdb-fragment04,857,"But the worst happens and you M_reel M_from it , you M_stagger , the M_shock is M_enormous , and then you begin to M_recover ."
cdb-fragment04,858,"You M_rally , you M_stand M_up and M_face it ."
cdb-fragment04,859,You get used M_to it .
cdb-fragment04,860,An hour maybe and you are M_making contingency M_plans .
cdb-fragment04,861,"For what had happened was not the worst , you realized M_that ."
cdb-fragment04,862,"The worst was yet to M_come , was perhaps always yet to M_come , never would actually M_come , because if it did you would know it , M_that would be reality , and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself ."
cdb-fragment04,863,Quickly .
cdb-fragment04,864,"Now that he was able to , he M_assembled what had happened and M_laid the facts M_before himself ."
cdb-fragment04,865,They had dug up M_those bones at Wyvis Hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating .
cdb-fragment04,866,"Bones , skeletons , bodies , do not bury themselves ."
cdb-fragment04,867,"M_Those were the facts , as M_far as he knew them M_up M_to M_this moment ."
cdb-fragment04,868,"He would know more , much more , M_in the days to M_come ."
cdb-fragment04,869,What was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key .
cdb-fragment04,870,It was defunct .
cdb-fragment04,871,"The M_passages it cancelled had , M_in any case , as M_in certain programmes , not been M_lost but M_stored on some M_limbo disc M_from whence they must now be M_retrieved ."
cdb-fragment04,872,"Adam sat in his parents ' house , drinking tea ."
cdb-fragment04,873,"There must be a total M_retrieval now , the one good M_thing M_about which was that it might M_banish his dreams ."
cdb-fragment04,874,"He was aware of a M_slight feeling of sickness and of cold , an absence of hunger , though he had been M_feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane ."
cdb-fragment04,875,"Anne sat next to him on his mother 's cretonne-covered settee and Abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor , kicking with her legs and punching with her arms ."
cdb-fragment04,876,His mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her .
cdb-fragment04,877,A M_passage M_from a novel by John O'Hara M_came M_back M_to Adam .
cdb-fragment04,878,"He had memorized it years ago M_in the Ecalpemos epoch : ‰Û÷ The safest M_way to live is first , inherit money , second , be born M_without M_taste for liquor , third , M_have a legitimate job that keeps you busy , fourth , marry a wife who will cooperate M_in your sexual peculiarities , fifth , M_join some M_big church , sixth , do n't live too long . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment04,879,Apart from the last one which he had n't M_got M_to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in America more than here ( here he had M_joined the golf club ) he had complied M_with all the rest .
cdb-fragment04,880,Or his M_nature and luck had M_complied for him .
cdb-fragment04,881,M_Nemesis M_had still M_come M_down like the M_wolf M_on the M_fold .
cdb-fragment04,882,He had not wanted to come back here .
cdb-fragment04,883,"But there had been no M_spirit M_in him , the M_shock of what his father told him had been too M_great ."
cdb-fragment04,884,"‰Û÷ Something that will interest you , Adam , something to M_make you M_sit M_up ."
cdb-fragment04,885,They 've dug up a M_lot of human bones at my old uncle 's house ‰Û_ ‰Û÷
cdb-fragment04,886,M_By the time he had M_rallied and M_got himself M_together and was thinking of M_things to say M_to the police it was too late and they were heading north .
cdb-fragment04,887,Anne was furious .
cdb-fragment04,888,When Lewis said to come back with him and eat there Adam had M_got a kick on the ankle from Anne and another kick when he had n't replied .
cdb-fragment04,889,"He had M_turned M_on her and said M_with M_cold savagery , ‰Û÷ For fuck 's sake , stop kicking me , will you ? ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment04,890,"He expected his father to M_rise and say something M_about M_that being no M_way to speak M_to one 's wife or not in front of the child , he was capable of M_that ."
cdb-fragment04,891,"But he had said nothing , only looked subdued , and Adam realized why ."
cdb-fragment04,892,His own terrible fear and anger had M_communicated itself M_to his father and M_shown him what the better M_part of valour was : keeping silent .
cdb-fragment04,893,"Having M_put the M_cat M_among the M_pigeons , M_made mischief M_in his special M_way , he was M_lying M_low now and waiting ."
cdb-fragment04,894,The old M_bastard .
cdb-fragment04,895,"Adam only wished Uncle Hilbert had M_left him Wyvis Hall and then there would have been no Ecalpemos , no Zosie , and no deaths ."
cdb-fragment04,896,And Adam could n't M_see he would have been much worse M_off .
cdb-fragment04,897,"He and Anne would be living in a house like M_this one , rather than M_that neo-Georgian M_palace ."
cdb-fragment04,898,"Children , M_after all , he thought , looking at Abigail , were happy wherever they were , so long as they were loved ‰Û_"
cdb-fragment04,899,His parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had M_had or how the flight had been .
cdb-fragment04,900,The conversation was exclusively M_on the M_subject of the discovery at Wyvis Hall .
cdb-fragment04,901,Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away .
cdb-fragment04,902,"If he had done the M_shock would have been less but M_on the other M_hand , his holiday would have been M_spoilt ."
cdb-fragment04,903,He would have liked very much to be alone .
cdb-fragment04,904,"Of course he knew there was no possibility of M_this , now or when he returned home , for when you were married you never could be alone ."
cdb-fragment04,905,Presumably M_that was the M_point .
cdb-fragment04,906,What was he going to tell Anne ?
cdb-fragment04,907,How much was he going to tell her ?
cdb-fragment04,908,He did n't know .
cdb-fragment04,909,"None of it , if he could M_help it ."
cdb-fragment04,910,They sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early M_high tea .
cdb-fragment04,911,Lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited Wyvis Hall and had walked in here and astounded them M_with his news .
cdb-fragment04,912,"‰Û÷ He had a beard then , Anne . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment04,913,Lewis 's M_subdued M_air had M_changed M_to one of M_high good humour .
cdb-fragment04,914,"‰Û÷ You would n't have recognized him , he looked like M_John the M_Baptist . ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment04,915,Adam could remember very well but he was n't M_going to say so .
cdb-fragment04,916,"‰Û÷ What a M_funny M_thing , ‰Ûª said Lewis ."
cdb-fragment04,917,‰Û÷ We M_had ham salad M_that day too .
cdb-fragment04,918,What a coincidence !
cdb-fragment04,919,"Oh , yes , I 've been meaning to ask you , who was it M_looked M_after Wyvis Hall while you were in Greece ? ‰Ûª"
cdb-fragment04,920,Adam could eat nothing .
cdb-fragment04,921,"The other time , he remembered , it was his father who had n't been able to eat ."
cdb-fragment04,922,"He did n't know what Lewis meant M_about someone M_looking M_after the house but no doubt he , Adam , had M_at the time M_concocted some M_tale to M_keep his father quiet , to M_keep him away even ."
cdb-fragment04,923,"‰Û÷ Someone from the village , you said , ‰Ûª Lewis persisted ."
cdb-fragment04,924,‰Û÷ How can I remember M_that M_far M_back ? ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment04,925,‰Û÷ The police will want to know .
cdb-fragment04,926,It may be of M_vital importance . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment04,927,"‰Û÷ Are n't you M_going to eat your meat , dear ? ‰Ûª said Beryl ."
cdb-fragment04,928,"Abigail , who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep , M_set M_up a wailing sound ."
cdb-fragment04,929,Adam was on his feet at once .
cdb-fragment04,930,‰Û÷ I think we should go . ‰Ûª
cdb-fragment04,931,They had to wait until his father was ready .
cdb-fragment04,932,Adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but Lewis would n't hear of it .
cdb-fragment04,933,Anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while Adam was in the M_back with Abigail .
cdb-fragment04,934,"If his father could have found out what flight they were coming M_on , the police certainly could ."
cdb-fragment04,935,It was possible they might be waiting for him .
cdb-fragment04,936,They would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of Wyvis Hall .
cdb-fragment04,937,He looked again at the newspaper M_account of the adjourned inquest that his father had M_saved for him .
cdb-fragment04,938,"It would be owners and occupants of Wyvis Hall M_between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview , and M_those were Great-Uncle Hilbert , who was dead , himself and Ivan Langan M_to whom he had sold the house ."
cdb-fragment04,939,"As for other occupants , how would they know who else had lived M_there ?"
cdb-fragment04,940,It was ironical that ten days before he had seen Shiva at Heathrow .
cdb-fragment04,941,"The encounter he now M_saw as an M_omen , a M_shadow M_cast by a coming event ."
cdb-fragment04,942,What would M_that event be ?
cdb-fragment04,943,"Adam did not want M_at M_this M_point to speculate , it M_made hi‰ÛÒ M_feel M_sick ."
cdb-fragment04,944,He turned the newspaper over so that he could not see M_that headline and M_those paragraphs .
cdb-fragment04,945,"M_In M_high M_spirits , his father was talking M_about the M_immense M_advances M_made M_in forensic science M_in recent years ."
cdb-fragment04,946,"As soon as they got home , Anne started getting Abigail to bed ."
cdb-fragment04,947,"Their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom , Adam looked Rufus Fletcher up M_in the phone book ."
cdb-fragment04,948,"He was M_in M_there twice , M_at a Wimpole Street number and again M_at an address in Mill Hill : Rufus H. Fletcher , MB , MRCP ."
cdb-fragment04,949,"All M_these years then , or for some of them , Rufus had been living three or four miles from him ."
cdb-fragment04,950,He could n't look Shiva up because he could n't remember his surname .
cdb-fragment04,951,"Women marry and M_change their names , he thought , there was no M_point M_in M_pursuing M_that one ."
cdb-fragment04,952,"Of course he could look up Robin Tatian but M_where , really , would M_that M_get him ?"
cdb-fragment04,953,"He was reaching-for the blue directory when Anne came back with Abigail in her arms , so Adam took her and carried her M_back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her ."
cdb-fragment04,954,She was almost asleep .
cdb-fragment04,955,He wondered if Rufus M_had children and if so did he M_worry M_about them M_coming M_to terrible harm the M_way Adam M_worried ?
cdb-fragment04,956,Was his M_whole life affected by what had happened at Ecalpemos ?
cdb-fragment04,957,"Adam might have M_escaped the file memories for years , M_suppressed them and M_jerked violently M_away M_from them , but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by M_those events ."
cdb-fragment04,958,Sometimes he M_felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the M_way he did because of their effects .
cdb-fragment04,959,"He sat by Abigail 's cot , not wanting to remember , but knowing that now he must ."
cdb-fragment04,960,There was nothing in his house to remind him of Ecalpemos .
cdb-fragment04,961,"Everything that was left , everything he and Rufus had n't sold , had M_gone M_to Ivan Langan M_with the house ."
cdb-fragment04,962,"For a M_song , too , because he had not been able to M_bear the thought of going back , meeting a valuer , walking about the house , picking things off shelves and out of cupboards ."
cdb-fragment04,963,"Only once had he returned after they all left and M_that had been bad enough , like a M_dream ‰ÛÓ no , like M_stepping M_into the M_set and M_scenario of some M_frightening M_film , a M_Hitchcock M_movie perhaps ."
cdb-fragment04,964,He asked the taxi he had M_taken to M_put him M_down at the M_top of the drift and he had walked to the house .
cdb-fragment04,965,"It was almost a year since he had been there and M_in M_that time nothing had been done , nothing had been touched ."

cdb-fragment04,967,"The drift was thickly overgrown , a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses M_caught at his clothes ."
cdb-fragment04,968,One of M_these M_whipped M_back at him and as he caught at it a thorn M_drove into the fleshy M_pad of his finger .
cdb-fragment04,969,"M_That thorn had been there , festering , for months ."

clp-fragment01,744,Conclusion
clp-fragment01,745,Task analysis has not and can not be M_reduced M_to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could M_acquire M_in a M_formal M_training M_course .
clp-fragment01,746,The techniques just described are no more than guidelines M_in what remains the M_creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do .
clp-fragment01,747,The danger M_in being too M_rigid is that justice will not be done M_to the M_flexibility and complexity of human performance .
clp-fragment01,748,"The danger of being too M_flexible is that the ergonomists will M_have an inadequate basis M_from which to M_design interfaces , M_training M_courses and other operator aids ."
clp-fragment01,749,If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task can not be allocated M_to a technical device rather than a human being .
clp-fragment01,750,Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system M_performance may be unreliable or unpredictable .
clp-fragment01,751,There is a necessary compromise which can only be M_arrived M_at M_in the M_context of a particular system .
clp-fragment01,752,As M_mentioned earlier there are always the M_twin problems of how to M_get the information and how to M_present it .
clp-fragment01,753,"It is sometimes easier to M_proceed M_on the basis of : ‰Û÷ If I were doing the job M_this is how I would do it ‰Ûª , but M_this can be delusory even for analysts who M_have past experience as operators ."
clp-fragment01,754,"For analysts who are designers M_creating a new task there may be no alternative , but any task description M_arrived M_at by M_this method should be checked M_against the behaviour of real operators as they M_gain experience ."
clp-fragment01,755,A particular difficulty M_about task M_synthesis is that there is no easy M_way of confirming completeness .
clp-fragment01,756,"A task description which is M_part of a M_design process should be fully ‰ÛÓ documented in terms of the M_origins of information , the assumptions M_made and the methods used ."
clp-fragment01,757,The standard method of M_producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks M_at various M_levels on cards and then M_assemble the cards M_in a M_network .
clp-fragment01,758,"There is a temptation to make M_these final diagrams very large , but often it is more useful to M_separate M_into M_small M_units M_with cross-referencing ."
clp-fragment01,759,"The optimum size seems to be A3 , M_this is easily copied and M_circulated but is large enough to M_contain considerable detail ."
clp-fragment01,760,"The procedure can be computerised , there are programmes available for the easy M_production , M_manipulation and M_storage of M_block diagrams M_with useful cross-referencing M_facilities ."
clp-fragment01,761,There is an inherent difficulty M_in that often the main dividend M_from a task analysis is M_from the act of obtaining it .
clp-fragment01,762,M_Those not involved M_find it difficult to M_gain very much M_from a presentation of a task description .
clp-fragment01,763,"Like reference books , they have to be used rather than read ."
clp-fragment01,764,"Task analysis can be very expensive M_in skilled manpower , but M_in M_looking M_at cost/value it is important to M_include M_in value the increase M_in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team M_conducts the analysis ."
clp-fragment01,765,If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method rather than a M_long series of group meetings .
clp-fragment01,766,"Political , economic and social issues which M_arise M_in M_conducting Task Analyses are M_discussed M_in the M_context of Job Analysis ( p. 148 ) ."
clp-fragment01,767,M_Application
clp-fragment01,768,Man-power planning
clp-fragment01,769,The ‰Û÷ Human M_Resource ‰Ûª concept of man-power as the M_central profitå_M_generating M_asset of any organisation has M_made some M_progress M_over the past twenty years .
clp-fragment01,770,"There was particular interest M_around 1970 when companies were prosperous , M_stable and innovative ( IPM , 1972 , Patten , 1971 ) ."
clp-fragment01,771,"The objective is to revise and almost M_reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a M_resource M_consuming factor requiring regular payments , overheads M_in the M_form of heated , lighted , equipped workspaces and so on ."
clp-fragment01,772,"M_From the M_narrow accountancy M_viewpoint , people are a cost and it is M_desirable to M_keep M_this cost as M_low as possible ."
clp-fragment01,773,"M_In M_these terms it is very difficult to justify , for example , sending a M_member of staff M_on a M_training M_course ."
clp-fragment01,774,The M_training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away .
clp-fragment01,775,M_Where is the M_return ?
clp-fragment01,776,The M_return is actually M_in the improved human M_resource but M_this is not readily measurable M_in terms which accountants use .
clp-fragment01,777,"There have been two attempts to M_reduce human M_resources M_to M_this M_form of M_measurement ( Giles and Robinson , 1972 ) ."
clp-fragment01,778,One is to M_acquire a human M_asset multiplier for each M_level of staff .
clp-fragment01,779,The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases M_with staff M_level and becomes three or more for management .
clp-fragment01,780,The other is to add M_together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker M_from the original job advertisement M_through M_to the retirement or redundancy payments .
clp-fragment01,781,"The first does M_attempt to M_obtain a value , the second remains essentially a cost and not a value ."
clp-fragment01,782,It would be unduly optimistic to M_assume that management skills have M_risen M_to a M_level such that costs M_undertaken can be M_assumed to be equivalent M_to value .
clp-fragment01,783,A less M_direct M_measure which is applicable only M_to the most M_senior management is to observe the M_fall or M_rise of the share price when a particular executive M_leaves or M_joins a company .
clp-fragment01,784,"M_This can be very M_high , for a M_large company a change M_in M_market value of millions of pounds is not unusual ."
clp-fragment01,785,The most M_serious consequence of the accountancy M_view of man-power is that M_high M_level policy decision-making does not M_give M_this factor sufficient M_weight .
clp-fragment01,786,"For example , the main board of a company will M_have complete details of cost and values of physical M_resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively M_scanty data M_about the man-power which is their most important M_asset ."
clp-fragment01,787,Indeed it will be M_described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known .
clp-fragment01,788,"Similarly , M_broad factors such as the M_state of morale will again only be described by M_negative M_features such as absenteeism , stoppages , M_strikes , M_low quality output and so on ."
clp-fragment01,789,"It is obvious that company output and projects must M_reflect the man-power and its M_performance M_level , but , if M_this is acknowledged at all , it is only M_in M_brief verbal terms M_within , for example , the chairman 's annual report ."
clp-fragment01,790,"The obsession , of current management , M_with measurement and the M_reduction of every variable M_to numbers for ease of computer M_manipulation has worsened the M_situation ."
clp-fragment01,791,Unfortunately there is no easy M_remedy .
clp-fragment01,792,Human M_resources are too complex a variable to be easily M_susceptible M_to measurement M_beyond the M_level of counting heads and trades .
clp-fragment01,793,Key variables such as the quality of staff M_at any M_level and the current morale are only M_expressible in general verbal descriptive terms .
clp-fragment01,794,"It is generally accepted ( p. 145 ) that ‰Û÷ hygiene ‰Ûª type variables such as pay and working conditions can , if they are inappropriately specified , M_depress morale and motivation but they will not M_in themselves result M_in very M_high M_levels of M_these parameters ."
clp-fragment01,795,Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work M_in the sense of work variety opportunities and M_attitudes of management .
clp-fragment01,796,M_These factors are worthy of M_emphasis because M_in practice they are still M_dealt M_with very badly M_in many organisations and yet it M_takes little trouble or expertise to M_make an enormous difference .
clp-fragment01,797,"for example , very few M_senior managements M_take the trouble to M_keep workers fully informed M_about policies and likely changes ."
clp-fragment01,798,The result is excessive reliance M_on rumour and M_continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious M_in morale terms .
clp-fragment01,799,The two human factors which can be unambiguously M_measured are age and sex .
clp-fragment01,800,The age M_distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important M_source of information .
clp-fragment01,801,For most purposes a M_rectangular M_distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate M_mix of youthful enthusiasm and M_ageing experience .
clp-fragment01,802,It also M_makes for regular changes as staff M_retire and are M_replaced .
clp-fragment01,803,"Many M_distributions M_show a M_peak M_in a particular age M_group mainly associated M_with taking on a M_large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised , M_this is not M_desirable because it M_leads M_to excessive competition for promotion M_at particular M_stages ."
clp-fragment01,804,"M_These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces M_where there is little tendency to move out , M_this is characteristic of a surprisingly M_large number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A."
clp-fragment01,805,M_Stable work forces M_have their advantages in terms of M_familiarity M_with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result M_in problems if the M_market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable .
clp-fragment01,806,"M_This is particularly so M_in M_high technology e.g. design and construction of ships , aircraft , power stations and chemical M_plant , M_where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is M_extensive ."
clp-fragment01,807,"Some M_peaks of demand can be M_dealt M_with by M_using consultants , but they tend to be expensive and do not always M_fit well M_with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation ."
clp-fragment01,808,M_In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the M_length of in-house experience required to achieve the required M_level of expertise M_in particular topics and compare M_this M_with the lead time for particular product requirements .
clp-fragment01,809,Given time available to M_train new staff it is not necessary to M_keep more than a M_nucleus M_in M_that particular expertise .
clp-fragment01,810,"M_On the other M_hand , if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to M_keep staff who M_have periods M_with M_little to do M_between projects ."
clp-fragment01,811,It is also desirable to M_have the possibility of M_shifting staff M_between design and operational duties .
clp-fragment01,812,"M_This not only provides M_flexibility M_in the use of man-power , it also improves communication ."
clp-fragment01,813,M_These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to M_force many organisations to become M_larger and M_larger if they are to remain economic .
clp-fragment01,814,M_Size provides a M_cushion M_to the vicissitudes of M_markets but it creates other problems .
clp-fragment01,815,"For example , difficulties of communications and in particular , how to inculcate the M_feeling M_within each individual that he and his performance are important M_to the organisation ."
clp-fragment01,816,M_This is considered M_in more detail M_in Chapter 3 .
clp-fragment01,817,"Human M_resources should be fundamental M_to M_subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially M_people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped M_at any M_level M_from a continent M_through countries , regions and companies M_down M_to particular working systems ."
clp-fragment01,818,M_This is one reason why policy M_makers never seem to M_take M_account fully of the people affected by their decisions .
clp-fragment01,819,The M_design of procedures
clp-fragment01,820,The increased importance of standardised informational M_support for both machines and operators has M_led M_to the concept of procedures as a separate M_design issue M_within a system ( Fig. 1.30 ) .
clp-fragment01,821,Much of M_this information can be incorporated M_in computer programs but there is also a need for M_extensive printed paper for the use of the operator .
clp-fragment01,822,"M_This M_takes three main M_forms : checklists , routines and knowledge-texts ."
clp-fragment01,823,The terminology M_in M_this M_field is not standardised .
clp-fragment01,824,"Software might be M_restricted , as M_in M_this book , M_to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to M_include all M_sources of information ."
clp-fragment01,825,Procedures is sometimes used for what are M_here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator 's information M_support except software .
clp-fragment01,826,The M_situation is M_further M_confused when some but not all the operator information M_support is itself M_computer-based .
clp-fragment01,827,Sometimes the term firm-ware is used .
clp-fragment01,828,However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for M_design effort .
clp-fragment01,829,The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers M_followed some M_simple guide-lines ( Table 1.16 ) .
clp-fragment01,830,Many documents are written M_on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise and style of thinking .
clp-fragment01,831,Similarly it is M_assumed that the conditions M_under which the reading will M_take M_place are the same as M_those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office .
clp-fragment01,832,"They may have to be read in the open air , in rain and darkness or within a M_plant M_under oily , cramped , poorly lit conditions ."
clp-fragment01,833,The user probably M_has limited expertise and he may be working M_under various M_stress conditions .
clp-fragment01,834,"The material on which the information is printed , the typeface used , the sequence , the M_structure and the format generally should M_reflect the conditions of use , ( Easterby and Zwaga , 1984 ) ."
clp-fragment01,835,All M_these M_things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users M_under the normal conditions of use .
clp-fragment01,836,Checklists
clp-fragment01,837,"Checklists are used M_in the pre-start mode , for routine maintenance and for fault-finding ."
clp-fragment01,838,They normally M_take the M_form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to M_guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components .
clp-fragment01,839,"The sequence is M_dictated by the optimal order M_in which actions should be M_taken , for example M_in starting up an aircraft ."
clp-fragment01,840,"There are many M_situations when the order is of no M_great consequence , for example a safety audit of a new machine , and M_in M_this latter case some logical M_structure is needed ."
clp-fragment01,841,"As M_mentioned M_above , the logic of the M_design may not be the optimal basis if the M_way the operator thinks and acts is different ."
clp-fragment01,842,Baker ( 1984 ) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming M_emerge when checklists are validated M_in the real M_situation .
clp-fragment01,843,The operator may deviate M_from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks .
clp-fragment01,844,"Systematic use of a checklist often M_reveals faults M_in work M_design such as inadequate M_access , visibility and labelling ."
clp-fragment01,845,"The checklist itself may be inconsistent , incomplete , imprecise or ambiguous ."
clp-fragment01,846,"Finally the checklist may M_have reprographic limitations such as inadequate M_vertical or M_horizontal M_structure , M_poor typefaces and insufficient M_linking of requirements , descriptions , remarks and tick-off M_points ."
clp-fragment01,847,The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is M_reproduced M_in Edholm ( 1967 ) .
clp-fragment01,848,There is a deceptive simplicity M_about such lists which requires M_extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent M_content .
clp-fragment01,849,"The M_context is , of course , the M_context of ergonomics as M_conceived by the designers of the list ."
clp-fragment01,850,Routines
clp-fragment01,851,A routine is the most common M_form of instructional M_material .
clp-fragment01,852,"The reader is required to M_follow a series of M_steps which might , for example , M_introduce a change M_in the M_performance of a complex system ."
clp-fragment01,853,Normally routines are single M_chains of instructions although it is possible to M_have some conditional M_branching .
clp-fragment01,854,"Each M_step should be M_simple and complete M_in itself ‰ÛÓ preferably M_with some indication that successful completion has been achieved , for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light , or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change M_in the M_flow of some material ."
clp-fragment01,855,As mentioned earlier a routine can often be M_regarded as a written task description .
clp-fragment01,856,By definition and M_design intention routines are M_inflexible .
clp-fragment01,857,The user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction .
clp-fragment01,858,"No M_great skill or intellectual effort is required , which is one M_way of M_saying that the human operator is being M_under-used , but the purpose of a routine is usually to M_avoid common human error such as omitting a M_step or M_reversing M_steps ."
clp-fragment01,859,"In general the value of M_formal routines is precisely that the operator , M_left M_to himself , will not normally function M_in such a systematic sequential manner ."
clp-fragment01,860,Knowledge texts
clp-fragment01,861,Knowledge is M_contained M_in documents which may vary M_from single sheet presentations M_to M_large manuals .
clp-fragment01,862,"As instructional M_material it is M_indirect in that the reader is not necessarily M_told what to do , as M_in a routine ."
clp-fragment01,863,Rather he is informed M_about the M_situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge M_base M_from which he can work out his own actions .
clp-fragment01,864,"Nevertheless , the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected ."
clp-fragment01,865,It is too easy to M_follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake .
clp-fragment01,866,"The ‰Û÷ need to know ‰Ûª criterion is crucial because unless it is M_applied , the operator can be overburdened M_with unnecessary M_material ."
clp-fragment01,867,Correspondingly the M_material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used .
clp-fragment01,868,M_In M_this M_context the operator requires a M_guide for action and not a scientific text-book .
clp-fragment01,869,"It is invariably better to provide M_material diagrammatically , systematically or at least M_in well-structured M_short paragraphs rather than M_in M_flowing prose ."
clp-fragment01,870,M_Consider for example how readily information M_about the relative position of streets is available M_from a map of a town M_centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets .
clp-fragment01,871,Such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town .
clp-fragment01,872,M_Note the M_enormous M_flexibility compared M_with a routine which would M_tell him only how to get from one particular M_point to another .
clp-fragment01,873,"A second important difference is that if he misses his place M_in a routine he will be totally M_lost , whereas if he happens to go M_in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to M_make whatever M_correction is necessary ."
clp-fragment01,874,However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only M_in M_making decisions M_about how to M_proceed but also M_in M_filtering M_out the required information M_from the M_massive irrelevance ( for a particular task ) which is equally available .
clp-fragment01,875,"Thus , one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines M_with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable ."
clp-fragment01,876,M_With two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to M_avoid too much homogeneity and provide M_substructure M_in the M_form of main roads and key buildings or other M_features such as rivers .
clp-fragment01,877,"See , for example , Fig. 5.3"
clp-fragment01,878,"Manuals which may M_contain maps , schematic diagrams and other M_materials M_warrant separate consideration ."
clp-fragment01,879,The M_design of manuals
clp-fragment01,880,A manual is usually M_in the M_form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer .
clp-fragment01,881,It is part of the communication package from the designer to the user .
clp-fragment01,882,Thus it is a particular M_form of job aid which provides the operator M_with information M_on a system and its performance .
clp-fragment01,883,The M_standard of manual M_design has traditionally been very M_low for several reasons .
clp-fragment01,884,"For M_this purpose , the designer is too familiar M_with the product and he rarely M_takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know ."
clp-fragment01,885,"Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly M_at the M_end of a project when the budget is M_running M_out , and it is M_regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential M_design work has been completed ."
clp-fragment01,886,The problem is particularly acute for computers .
clp-fragment01,887,"Manuals for cars , machine tools and so on are M_poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions ."
clp-fragment01,888,"Most computer operators do not know or wish to know M_about the mechanisms , and M_in any case M_these are not M_accessible M_to vision and manipulation ."
clp-fragment01,889,"The computer operator is entirely dependent M_on the manual , at least M_in the early M_stages of gaining familiarity M_with the system and its functions ."
clp-fragment01,890,He is usually very badly M_served although the principles of manual M_design are well known .
clp-fragment01,891,For most systems the manual is best M_divided M_into M_parts as indicated M_in Table 1.17 .
clp-fragment01,892,"The first M_part should be a general M_introduction which orientates the readers M_towards the system , its purpose , its functional M_structure and mode of operation and its performance M_limits ."
clp-fragment01,893,M_This should be M_followed by a separate M_section M_on how to M_set the system M_up M_in the first M_place and how to check that it is M_working properly .
clp-fragment01,894,"If it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it , fix it M_into position , connect it to M_power supplies and start it up ."
clp-fragment01,895,"If it is large , the M_emphasis will be M_on the start up procedure ."
clp-fragment01,896,The M_section M_describing the operation of the system should M_cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it .
clp-fragment01,897,"M_Extensive use of line drawings , schematic diagrams , algorithmic lists is M_desirable , and M_where prose is used M_this also should be structured M_into M_short sentences M_with meaningful separation M_into paragraphs ."
clp-fragment01,898,"The maintenance M_section should indicate what , if anything , the operator is expected to do and the M_symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required ."
clp-fragment01,899,Tables subdivided M_into Faults/Reasons/M_Remedies can be extremely helpful .
clp-fragment01,900,Parts lists M_including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to M_deal M_with his own replacements .
clp-fragment01,901,A standard fault is to M_assume that the reader is familiar M_with the jargon which the designer habitually uses .
clp-fragment01,902,A glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only M_to the reader but also M_to the writer who is M_forced to M_consider carefully how he is using various technical terms .
clp-fragment01,903,"Finally , all manuals should end M_with an index which supplements the table of M_contents M_at the beginning ."

crs-fragment01,14,"M_In 1982 , 44 per cent of M_under fives in Islington M_had the use of an M_under-fives facility , 29 per cent M_on a full-time and 15 per cent M_on a part-time basis ."
crs-fragment01,15,"M_Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased , so that M_by 1988 there were 12 children 's day centres , M_about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department , and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority ."
crs-fragment01,16,"The Beacon Nursery , a local Mencap project , M_offered care five days per week to children M_over one year of age categorised as M_having severe learning difficulties ."
crs-fragment01,17,"Unlike council day centres , playgroups or community nurseries , the Beacon Nursery was M_free ."
crs-fragment01,18,Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available M_on demand .
crs-fragment01,19,The Beacon had been M_in existence for many years and M_in the past had catered for M_up M_to thirty children M_with a M_wide M_range of disabilities and needs .
crs-fragment01,20,M_By 1983 it M_had M_half M_that number M_on M_roll .
crs-fragment01,21,Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to M_fall as it was increasingly M_seen as a M_resource for children M_with severe and multiple disabilities .
crs-fragment01,22,"In addition the Elfreda Rathbone organisation , a voluntary organisation helping people M_with learning disabilities , M_ran a M_free day nursery in the borough for a M_small number of children M_with learning difficulties ."
crs-fragment01,23,"Some integrated services M_emerged M_in the early 1980s ‰ÛÓ one playscheme was developed M_through a parent 's initiative , and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation ."
crs-fragment01,24,Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently M_supported a local special school M_in integrating M_under fives M_into a playgroup .
crs-fragment01,25,"In addition to its mainstream schools , the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children M_with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs ‰ÛÓ one for children M_with moderate learning difficulties , one for children M_with severe learning difficulties , one for children M_with emotional and behavioural difficulties , one for autistic children , and one for children M_with physical disabilities ."
crs-fragment01,26,M_In 1983 three of M_these offered nursery places to children M_from the age of 2 .
crs-fragment01,27,"The children using all of M_these services came from a M_wide M_range of ethnic M_backgrounds , though rarely was M_this actively and positively M_reflected M_in the type of care provided or the ethnic M_background of their carers ."
crs-fragment01,28,Residential units
crs-fragment01,29,"M_By 1983 residential services were M_designed M_with ‰Û÷ care M_in the community ‰Ûª M_in mind , but most were based M_in specialist settings ."
crs-fragment01,30,"For example , Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children M_with learning difficulties , and was M_designed to offer respite ‰Û÷ round the clock ‰Ûª care ."
crs-fragment01,31,Parents had M_fought for M_this as a local M_resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home .
crs-fragment01,32,M_By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children 's respite care unit at Leigh Road .
crs-fragment01,33,"The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children M_in care ( M_by 1988 their number had been M_reduced M_to eleven ) , none with wheelchair access and only one M_with any experience of caring for children M_with learning difficulties ."
crs-fragment01,34,The Community Health Team
crs-fragment01,35,The Community Health Team M_had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision .
crs-fragment01,36,"It included physiotherapists , occupational and speech therapists , doctors , psychologists and a specialist health visitor ."
crs-fragment01,37,"They were joined M_in the M_network by specialist teachers , funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools , who visited children at home before they were due to start school ."
crs-fragment01,38,M_This group of people met M_on a regular basis to M_coordinate services and discuss professional issues .
crs-fragment01,39,Discussion of services to individual children also M_took M_place .
crs-fragment01,40,"M_This included deciding M_between day care or school , and parents ' M_attitudes M_to different options ."
crs-fragment01,41,Often a M_member of the group was delegated to advise parents M_on a M_course of action .
crs-fragment01,42,"The Community Health Team M_aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children M_from the earliest possible age , to enable them to develop M_to their M_fullest potential ."
crs-fragment01,43,"They were , however , an all-White group , M_operating M_without directly involving parents and were generally committed M_to specialist care M_in the community ."
crs-fragment01,44,They M_gave M_support M_to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members M_saw M_these settings as the best places to ‰Û÷ treat ‰Ûª children .
crs-fragment01,45,Because of their early M_contact with parents they often M_had considerable influence M_in M_steering parents M_towards specialist provision .
crs-fragment01,46,The Special Services Team
crs-fragment01,47,M_In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for ‰Û÷ partially hearing ‰Ûª children .
crs-fragment01,48,M_These social workers were based M_in the borough 's Special Services Team .
crs-fragment01,49,They all worked with some M_under fives attending the schools they M_covered .
crs-fragment01,50,They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not M_have adequate M_access M_to M_resources or M_support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability .
crs-fragment01,51,When a vacancy M_arose M_within M_this group of social workers M_in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising M_in work with M_under fives M_with special needs .
crs-fragment01,52,M_This might have M_had the effect of M_drawing families M_into the specialist M_system M_at an earlier M_stage .
crs-fragment01,53,"Instead , for a number of reasons , it proved to be a key M_step M_in the development of the debate M_about integration in Islington ."
crs-fragment01,54,"First , the post was not M_attached M_to any specialist institution ."
crs-fragment01,55,There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work M_closely with the Beacon Nursery .
crs-fragment01,56,"Second , the worker M_had an alternative peer group of M_under-fives workers who were key figures M_in M_controlling M_access M_to all other M_under-fives facilities ."
crs-fragment01,57,"Third , the worker was committed M_to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not M_take precedence M_over the child 's social , emotional and cultural needs ."
crs-fragment01,58,There was now a new worker M_in the M_network who also M_made an early relationship with families but who could present a M_broader choice of day care M_to parents .
crs-fragment01,59,ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY
crs-fragment01,60,"The Labour Council , elected M_in 1982 , M_had as a stated policy M_aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled M_to a pre-school place of some sort ."
crs-fragment01,61,M_This M_led M_to the initiation of an M_under-fives review .
crs-fragment01,62,"The review team , M_set M_up M_under the auspices of the Social Services Committee , included councillors , senior departmental management and representatives of the children 's day centre organisers and M_under-fives social workers M_in its membership ."
crs-fragment01,63,It proposed a M_network of M_under-fives centres throughout the borough ‰ÛÓ an idea which the M_under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time .
crs-fragment01,64,"Day care in each area would be organised and M_coordinated M_through the children 's day centres which would also provide information , M_support and M_resources M_to parents ."
crs-fragment01,65,The review had M_made no mention of children M_with special needs .
crs-fragment01,66,The specialist social worker and another M_under-fives worker M_with a personal interest M_in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine M_resources for M_these children .
crs-fragment01,67,"They interviewed parents , specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they M_designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers M_in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations , as well as by some child-minders ."
crs-fragment01,68,"Broadly , the survey M_confirmed that parents of children M_with special needs had not been M_given a real choice of placement , and that they had to M_fight M_hard for mainstream provision if M_this was their choice ."
crs-fragment01,69,Parents wanted to be M_part of the decision-making and did not M_feel that they were .
crs-fragment01,70,Many commented M_on lack of information M_about the M_range of facilities M_on offer .
crs-fragment01,71,"One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she M_felt that she was never M_given a choice of provision for her son , and objected M_to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good ."
crs-fragment01,72,She M_fought M_hard to M_get him a part-time playgroup place M_in the group his older brother attended .
crs-fragment01,73,Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to ‰Û÷ M_have a M_go ‰Ûª and the placement M_went M_ahead .
crs-fragment01,74,She commented :
crs-fragment01,75,I had to M_fight every M_step of the M_way for M_this .
crs-fragment01,76,"No one told me M_about it , and no one wanted him to M_have it ."
crs-fragment01,77,I knew it was right for him ‰ÛÓ M_this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children .
crs-fragment01,78,It does n't matter that he 's not like them .
crs-fragment01,79,"I know what is right for my child , but I 'm not supposed to say ."
crs-fragment01,80,"Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist ‰Û÷ therapy ‰Ûª time , but wanted it to be used M_in a more M_flexible M_way ."
crs-fragment01,81,Some parents were very M_worried that more integrated settings would M_lead M_to lack of attention for children M_with special needs .
crs-fragment01,82,"Definitions of ‰Û÷ special needs ‰Ûª varied M_widely M_in the questionnaire responses ‰ÛÓ some defining it as children M_with disabilities , some including children M_with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English ."
crs-fragment01,83,M_This M_made the survey difficult to interpret .
crs-fragment01,84,"The findings were documented M_in a report A Place For All Our Children ( CCUF 1983 ) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems M_in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child M_with special needs , M_with suggestions for how M_these might be overcome ."
crs-fragment01,85,"M_These ideas were M_informed by a paper which had already been M_produced by an active M_member of the local Mencap group , who had previously tried to M_generate the debate M_within the Community Health Service M_through the Mencap committee ."
crs-fragment01,86,The conference : ‰Û÷ A place for all our children'
crs-fragment01,87,"As a result of M_this work the Coordinating Committee for M_Under Fives ( CCUF ) , an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service M_to M_under fives , decided to organise a conference to M_look M_at the issues of integration of special needs children M_within mainstream provision ."
crs-fragment01,88,Prior to the conference various groups met to M_produce short contributions M_to the debate .
crs-fragment01,89,"M_These included parents , M_under-fives workers , specialist workers , children 's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers ."
crs-fragment01,90,Each of M_these groups M_came M_up M_with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending .
crs-fragment01,91,"M_About 230 people attended the conference , M_held M_in April 1985 ."
crs-fragment01,92,"Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies , overcoming practical problems for children M_in integrated provision and available M_sources of information ."
crs-fragment01,93,The conference M_made the following recommendations :
crs-fragment01,94,1
crs-fragment01,95,"For a formal , universal information M_system , M_covering local and specialist M_resources ."
crs-fragment01,96,2
crs-fragment01,97,For children 's needs to be M_considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised .
crs-fragment01,98,3
crs-fragment01,99,"For employment of extra staff where needed , and employment of peripatetic special needs workers ."
crs-fragment01,100,4
crs-fragment01,101,"For availability of money for equipment , toys and adaptations ."
crs-fragment01,102,5
crs-fragment01,103,For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children M_with special needs .
crs-fragment01,104,6
crs-fragment01,105,For priority status for children M_with special needs in order to facilitate M_access M_to ordinary provision .
crs-fragment01,106,7
crs-fragment01,107,"For training facilities for staff M_in ordinary provision , specialist provision and child-minders ."
crs-fragment01,108,8
crs-fragment01,109,For M_greater communication and sharing of M_resources M_between ordinary and specialist provision .
crs-fragment01,110,9
crs-fragment01,111,"For therapeutic and professional staff to M_reflect the cultural M_backgrounds of the children , and that for all children , including M_those M_with special needs , their day-care M_environment and activities to M_express a M_consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington ."
crs-fragment01,112,"It was M_made M_clear that all of the M_above M_areas needed funding from health , education and social services before they could be implemented ."
crs-fragment01,113,"Finally , it was M_felt that unless the M_attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive M_towards integration , none of the recommendations could be effective ."
ea7-fragment03,790,( d ) Warfare and crusades
ea7-fragment03,791,The poet Marbod of Rennes M_celebrated ( M_in Latin ) the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops :
ea7-fragment03,792,"The poem M_highlights two important twelfth-century developments : the use of M_force M_in M_punishing aristocratic crime ( the M_fruit of princely peace-keeping ) , and the M_increasing significance of siege-engines M_in warfare ."
ea7-fragment03,793,"Intellectuals claimed a formative influence M_in the second too : John of Marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read Vegetius ' De Re Militari M_to Geoffrey le Bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan , and ascribed his success M_to their advice M_on firebombs ."
ea7-fragment03,794,"But common sense may have been more important than learning M_in perceiving the M_vulnerability of most castles M_to ‰ÛÓ battering-rams and catapults ; for even M_in 1100 they were , as a rule , primitive structures ."
ea7-fragment03,795,"Siege-engines M_demanded M_on the one M_hand skilled operators , and M_on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials ."
ea7-fragment03,796,M_This effectively M_restricted their use M_to the wealthy and M_to those whose claim M_to assistance M_under the ban was incontrovertible .
ea7-fragment03,797,"Equally , the improvements M_in fortification needed to withstand their effects ‰ÛÓ thick stone walls , inner as well as outer defences ‰ÛÓ required incomes greater than M_those of simple lords ."
ea7-fragment03,798,"The M_net effect was that , given dedication , princes ‰ÛÓ Louis VI , Geoffrey le Bel , Alphonse-Jourdain ‰ÛÓ could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes , and could build castles of their own which were impregnable M_to all but lengthy and sustained attack ."
ea7-fragment03,799,"Henry II 's castle at Chinon , where the treasury of Anjou was situated , was the model for its M_generation , with its halls , upper chambers , tower , and M_curtain walling , set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire ."
ea7-fragment03,800,"It could be M_copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly M_on defence ‰ÛÓ princes , M_great bishops or , M_in the south especially , towns ."
ea7-fragment03,801,All others became vulnerable .
ea7-fragment03,802,John of Salisbury 's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of Gaul M_feared Henry I of England was M_revealing of the new M_situation .
ea7-fragment03,803,"Similarly , campaigning M_in the field imposed an M_increasing financial M_burden ."
ea7-fragment03,804,"The treaty M_between Robert II of Flanders and Henry I of England , renewed by their successors , stipulated that each knight M_supplied M_to the English king should bring three horses with him ‰ÛÓ M_this M_at a time when a horse represented a major investment ."
ea7-fragment03,805,Then knightly armour M_grew more elaborate and costly M_throughout the century .
ea7-fragment03,806,"And though some knights might be supplied M_free by feudal service , household ones had to be M_maintained by their lords , mercenary ones needed pay , and those M_with money-fiefs constituted a regular M_charge M_on the treasury ."
ea7-fragment03,807,"Besides , away from their home base , knights were useless M_on their own ."
ea7-fragment03,808,"M_In M_open battle and M_in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal M_form of aggressive warfare , they needed the M_backing of archers , both mounted and M_on foot , and of numerous infantrymen ."
ea7-fragment03,809,"The usual M_source of supply was town militias ‰ÛÓ Suger mentions M_those of Rheims , ChÌ¢lons , Laon , Soissons , OrlÌ©ans , Etampes , and Paris M_in the royal army of 1124 ."
ea7-fragment03,810,"But they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from Flanders and the Low Countries , where the rapidly M_expanding population M_forced M_large numbers of young men M_into military careers ."
ea7-fragment03,811,"M_In the M_eyes of the faithful , these ‰Û÷ Brabanters ‰Ûª , M_with their freebooting and lack of discipline M_after the M_end of campaigns , were as dangerous as heretics ; M_in 1171 Frederick Barbarossa and Louis VII agreed to expel them from their lands ."
ea7-fragment03,812,"Their M_value M_in battle , as M_shields behind which the knights could M_shelter M_before they M_launched their M_charge , ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them ‰ÛÓ notably Henry II of England ."
ea7-fragment03,813,But the hatred they aroused M_meant that they were M_liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards .
ea7-fragment03,814,"Inevitably , therefore , war M_on the grand M_scale as fought by princes M_bore little resemblance M_in practice M_to the feuds of lesser men ."
ea7-fragment03,815,"The divergence was M_sharpened by the M_application of a theoretical distinction , the M_fruit of Augustinian theology , M_amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference ; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars ( fought M_against aggressors M_with the M_aim of re-establishing peace ) or public wars ( declared by a competent authority M_in the public interest ) , while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace ."
ea7-fragment03,816,"Geoffrey Martel had M_perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century ; later it enabled Henry the Liberal of Champagne to claim the military M_service of all lords within his county , a M_reapplication of the Carolingian ban ."
ea7-fragment03,817,So it could be a powerful M_weapon .
ea7-fragment03,818,"Yet the logic of the definition M_suggested that it would benefit especially kings , whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him M_service when he fought M_against Louis VI ; they claimed discretion M_in the matter ; and M_in 1184 , the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to M_commit M_to battle the army he had summoned M_against Philip Augustus , M_through fear that its ranks might M_melt M_away ."
ea7-fragment03,819,The M_contrast M_with the M_united M_front Louis VI and his troops presented M_to the emperor Henry V M_in 1124 was marked .
ea7-fragment03,820,"A royal banner now M_bestowed respectability M_on a M_cause ; kings ' wars were M_assumed to be for the sake of peace , even when M_cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage ."
ea7-fragment03,821,"M_This M_goes some M_way M_to explaining why the M_complicated campaigns within Toulouse M_in the second M_half of the century were largely fought out M_under the banners of the Angevin , Aragonese , and French kings ; and why the revolts of Henry II 's sons had widespread ramifications ."
ea7-fragment03,822,"The twelfth century was characterized , therefore , by fewer but more protracted wars , which M_smouldered for M_long periods M_between M_short , M_sharp bouts of conflict , like the war that M_covered must of the reigns of Henry I of England and Louis VI of France , the one M_inaugurated by the M_great rebellion of 1173 , which M_outlived both Louis VII and Henry II , or M_that M_against Catalan claims M_in the south ."
ea7-fragment03,823,M_Into M_these M_large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed .
ea7-fragment03,824,"The M_pattern caused problems , in that the circumstances which might trigger M_off renewed fighting were unpredictable ; yet the moment an opportunity M_offered , princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies ; there was no time for lengthy preparation ."
ea7-fragment03,825,"The usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy 's territory , plundering and looting ; to M_take fortified places if the task was easy ; to obtain allies among the lords of the locality ; and to retreat M_without fighting a battle if at all possible ‰ÛÓ M_in effect an M_application M_to a M_wider M_canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier M_made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles ."
ea7-fragment03,826,"It necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to M_join a M_core of highly-trained troops kept constantly , M_at the ready ‰ÛÓ the princes ' military M_households , which became the linch pin of the M_system ."
ea7-fragment03,827,"John of Marmoutier 's life of Geoffrey le Bel M_offers a M_glimpse of how M_strong M_bonds were created M_between the prince and his followers within the M_household , and how a M_high M_level of training was M_maintained M_at all times ."
ea7-fragment03,828,"Geoffrey was brought up M_from infancy with the sons of neighbouring Angevin lords , M_on whose companionship he relied ."
ea7-fragment03,829,"When it M_came time for him to be knighted by Henry I in Rouen , he set off for Normandy with a crowd of these young men about him ."
ea7-fragment03,830,"In Rouen , the occasion was celebrated M_with pomp , elaborate dress , and a great feast , and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament , at which Geoffrey M_naturally won the M_highest honours ."
ea7-fragment03,831,"It was M_within M_this kind of M_environment that chivalry M_flourished , that young men learned to identify , their vassalage M_towards their lord as a M_symbol of their honour , that they M_debated the relative merits of Roland 's and Oliver 's M_way of M_displaying loyalty ; and that they learned the M_finer M_points of jousting ."
ea7-fragment03,832,"Tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics , for they could be both bloody and dangerous ."
ea7-fragment03,833,Yet they supplied real needs : .
ea7-fragment03,834,M_that of an instruction M_in the martial arts compatible M_with the M_maintenance of a prince 's peace ; M_that of an M_outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court ; and M_that of display to M_maintain princely social status .
ea7-fragment03,835,So they M_flourished everywhere .
ea7-fragment03,836,They M_offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire M_great M_position M_in the world ‰ÛÓ Arnoul of Ardres M_caught the M_eye of Countess Ida of Boulogne M_through his exploits ; and they also conferred M_lustre M_on the great ‰ÛÓ Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were throughout France for their distinguished performances M_in M_these show battles .
ea7-fragment03,837,All M_this formed a M_background M_to the first century of crusading ; and it M_goes some M_way M_to explaining the more secular M_aspects of the M_magnetism which M_drew French knights to M_take M_up the M_cross M_in their thousands .
ea7-fragment03,838,"Urban II , M_launching the First Crusade at Clermont M_in 1095 , M_presented it as a natural evolution of the peace M_movement : warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles M_in a M_campaign to M_promote the interests of Holy Church ."
ea7-fragment03,839,"The war , declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable , was to M_free the Eastern churches , to end Muslim M_guardianship of the holy places , to M_restore Jerusalem M_to its proper state ."
ea7-fragment03,840,"As princes M_saw it , it was a just war M_in the M_fullest M_sense of the M_term ; those who were slaughtered M_in its battles were M_regarded as among the martyrs of the church ."
ea7-fragment03,841,"When Raymond of Toulouse , Robert II of Flanders , Robert Curthose , Stephen of Blois , and Hugh of Vermandois M_responded M_to the M_call , past and present M_members of their military M_households M_fell almost M_automatically M_into rank M_behind them , to test themselves M_against terrible dangers , but also to enjoy the companionship M_in arms , the adventure , the deeds of daring which were the M_stuff of the chansons de geste ."
ea7-fragment03,842,"That they M_shared , along with all other participants M_in the crusade , a fervent devotion , a M_conviction that their sins would be forgiven , is certain ."
ea7-fragment03,843,"Yet for them crusading necessitated no M_large M_leap of the imagination , no millenarian M_vision ; it was simply a challenging and a deserving M_extension of their everyday activities ."
ea7-fragment03,844,"M_In French M_eyes , the hero of the First Crusade was Robert II of Flanders ."
ea7-fragment03,845,"While Raymond of Toulouse remained in Outremer , Stephen and Hugh disgraced themselves M_in escaping M_from the siege of Antioch , and Robert Curthose , no matter how gallant , at least M_in his lifetime failed to M_impress , Robert II 's prestige M_soared M_to the M_skies ."
ea7-fragment03,846,He became Robert of Jerusalem M_to his contemporaries ; his deeds were recorded M_in the Song of Antioch ; his pious bravery totally M_expunged the memory of Robert the Frisian 's usurpation ; and M_after his death his son Baldwin VII M_harped M_on his father 's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion M_against the enemies of the church .
ea7-fragment03,847,"Outside Flanders , Robert 's sister 's marriage M_to Roger of Sicily was a M_mark of his new M_position M_in the world ; like Louis VI 's sister 's marriage M_to Bohemond of Antioch , it M_stretched French kinship M_connections into the new Norman colonies , ensuring that travellers from the homeland would M_find a welcome in those distant parts ."
ea7-fragment03,848,Robert 's example was a potent one .
ea7-fragment03,849,"M_After the next M_change M_in dynasty , Thierry and Philip of Alsace M_strengthened their M_shaky claim M_to the comital M_position by attaining for themselves the prestige M_attached M_to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation ."
ea7-fragment03,850,"Thierry 's M_remote M_connection M_with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon , along with his marriage M_with Sybilla of Anjou , Fulk V 's daughter , M_gave him some claim M_to the throne of Jerusalem ; as a consequence , the aristocracy of Outremer M_viewed him and Philip M_with M_mixed M_feelings , expecting much of them , yet fearing their ambitions ."
ea7-fragment03,851,"M_In the end , it was not in Outremer but in the newly conquered Byzantine empire that the Flemish crusading achievement was M_crowned M_with the M_elevation of Count Baldwin IX M_to the imperial throne M_in 1204 ."
ea7-fragment03,852,"But M_in the twelfth century , the house of Alsace could afford the M_high costs of their expeditions ‰ÛÓ Thierry went to Jerusalem four times , Philip twice ‰ÛÓ and the counts ' repeated absences M_in fact M_promoted administrative reform ; the baillis and the Grote Bref were as much the M_products of crusading as the English and Norman judicial M_system and exchequers were the M_product of the king-duke 's M_divided attentions ."
ea7-fragment03,853,"But if , M_on M_balance , the Flemish counts benefited materially M_from crusading , ‰ÛÓ as , arguably , did the Angevin ‰ÛÓ they were far from typical ."
ea7-fragment03,854,For other French houses a commitment M_to Outremer often represented a M_sacrifice of domestic political interest .
ea7-fragment03,855,"The achievements of Raymond IV St Gilles M_in consolidating his authority within Toulouse were M_threatened by his departure M_in 1095 , especially since it was known that he M_had no intention of returning home ."
ea7-fragment03,856,"Then his example M_lured his elder son Bertrand to Tripoli M_in 1112 , and his younger son Alphonse Jourdain there M_in 1147 ."
ea7-fragment03,857,"Had not his grandson Raymond V fulfilled his crusading obligation M_in his early youth , thereby M_freeing himself M_from the M_necessity of interrupting his career in the county , the principality of Toulouse might have M_disintegrated altogether ."
ea7-fragment03,858,William IX 's crusade of 1101 brought about M_serious financial problems in Aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation M_in the hitherto M_stable currency ; and Robert Curthose 's decision to mortgage Normandy M_to William Rufus in order to M_cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict M_over the duchy which was not M_settled M_until the death of his son William Clito in 1128 .
ea7-fragment03,859,"All M_in all , it was not surprising that Suger , mulling over the precedents of early crusading , M_tried to dissuade Louis VII M_from M_embarking M_on his Jerusalem journey M_in 1145 ."
ea7-fragment03,860,"Yet the M_appeal of crusading was , if anything , even M_stronger M_to those aristocratic houses just M_below the M_level of the princely : it was , M_after all , the house of Boulogne which M_produced the first two rulers of Jerusalem ."
ea7-fragment03,861,"The counts of Nevers , the lords of Montpellier , the lords of Amboise and Lusignan , the Trencavels , were fervent devotees of the ideal ; so the problems of absences , shipwrecks , death abroad plagued them as much as their princes ."
ea7-fragment03,862,"M_On occasion , their M_determination to M_sacrifice for Christ M_played M_directly M_into their overlord 's M_hands , as when the count of La Marche , who M_had no M_direct heir , sold his county M_to King Henry II in 1177 ."
ea7-fragment03,863,"When it did not , accompanying their princes M_in a joint crusading venture , as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX , created new personal M_links ."
ea7-fragment03,864,The political M_spin-offs M_from crusading are therefore more difficult to M_calculate than M_at first M_glance they might M_appear .
ea7-fragment03,865,Nevertheless it is M_clear that the M_chief gainer was Louis VII .
ea7-fragment03,866,"The irony of M_this M_lay M_in the fact that the Second Crusade was counter-productive in Outremer , embittered relations M_with Byzantium , and resulted M_in the deaths of M_enormous numbers of its participants , particularly M_those M_drawn M_from the nonå_aristocratic classes ."
ea7-fragment03,867,"Yet it consolidated the king 's M_position within France , partly M_through the skilled regency of Suger , but also because , M_in taking M_on himself the leadership of the expedition , Louis M_re-emerged as a credible ruler of men ."
ea7-fragment03,868,His noble M_gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy M_over the archbishopric of Bourges .
ea7-fragment03,869,The disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma : even the barons of Outremer continued to M_look M_on him as their one potential saviour .
ea7-fragment03,870,"His friendship M_with Raymond V of Toulouse , a fellow warrior , M_reversed the trend of history since the M_middle of the tenth century , M_in M_bringing the princes of the far south M_back M_into the king 's mouvance ."
ea7-fragment03,871,"The crowds of Burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him ; M_on their return , they sought the arbitration of the royal court M_in their disputes , and they welcomed Louis 's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of Burgundy ."
ea7-fragment03,872,"As William of St Denis M_put it ,"
ea7-fragment03,873,Even as early as 1147 it was apparent that the crusading M_movement had provided a new M_sense of aristocratic cohesion in the realm .
ea7-fragment03,874,"The great joint expeditions , the combined leaderships , although not M_without M_friction , had been justified by their outstanding achievement , the conquest and maintenance of Jerusalem ."
ea7-fragment03,875,"They were the Gesta Francorum , the deeds of the Franks , or the Gesta Dei per Francos , God 's deeds performed M_through the Franks , as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them ."
ea7-fragment03,876,But what was M_missing M_before 1147 was a M_clear M_sense of who the Franks were .
ea7-fragment03,877,"The Second Crusade , however , was M_launched M_with St Bernard 's M_ringing appeal M_to the count and barons of Brittany :"
ea7-fragment03,878,"M_In M_taking his place at the M_head of the Second Crusade , the Rex Francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the Franks M_into the French ."
ew1-fragment01,1,"Revival M_under Law , 1911‰ÛÒ1914"
ew1-fragment01,2,Few contemporaries would have expected Balfour 's retirement to M_lead M_to a Unionist M_recovery .
ew1-fragment01,3,The party was M_in a M_mutinous M_condition M_in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would M_have even half of Balfour 's political M_gifts .
ew1-fragment01,4,"Nor was it M_clear that Balfour 's M_departure was universally desired : M_at the National Union Conference a few days later , Leo Maxse was booed off the platform , and constituency parties everywhere M_passed resolutions M_regretting Balfour 's decision ."
ew1-fragment01,5,"A M_great many crocodile tears were M_shed , for , since Unionists M_had such an M_elevated M_view of the principle of leadership , they were unable to accept that they had just M_driven their own leader M_from office ."
ew1-fragment01,6,The M_shock caused by Balfour 's going thus M_did something to M_steady the party and it certainly M_produced a real determination to M_settle the affairs of the party M_with less M_friction than had been fashionable of late .
ew1-fragment01,7,"The main contenders for the leadership were Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long , representing the two different establishments of the Edwardian Unionist party ‰ÛÓ the M_opposite M_worlds of Birmingham and Wiltshire ‰ÛÓ but the M_situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders , Edward Carson and Andrew Bonar Law ."
ew1-fragment01,8,"Two M_strong M_groups M_emerged M_behind Long and Chamberlain , M_about equal M_in numbers , but there were few backers for Carson or Law ."
ew1-fragment01,9,"Carson thereupon M_fell M_out M_of the contest ‰ÛÓ or rather M_announced that he was not M_standing , for no official nominations had been M_made ."
ew1-fragment01,10,"The party officers and Whips were M_solidly M_behind Chamberlain , but Law M_drew M_off some of his M_support M_among tariff reformers and , urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken , he refused to M_withdraw unless his continued candidature would M_allow Long to win ."
ew1-fragment01,11,"M_Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist ( as was Lansdowne , who M_led the Unionists M_in the Lords ) and that he had not been entirely loyal M_to Balfour since the referendum M_pledge ."
ew1-fragment01,12,Long was M_supported by the M_bulk of the English county M_members but by few of the party 's men of talent .
ew1-fragment01,13,M_By the morning of Friday 10 November it was M_clear that neither Chamberlain nor Long would M_secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly M_follow the other .
ew1-fragment01,14,A party meeting was to be M_held M_on the M_following Monday and the Whips were M_making preparation for a vote to be M_taken .
ew1-fragment01,15,Chamberlain provided the M_way M_out by suggesting M_to Balcarres that both he and Long should M_withdraw and so allow Law to be elected unanimously ; he also M_turned M_down Balcarres 's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would M_make such a M_mess of M_things that Chamberlain would be M_bound to succeed M_within the year .
ew1-fragment01,16,"M_Faced M_with Chamberlain 's proposition , and M_without a majority of his own , Long M_had no option but to agree ."
ew1-fragment01,17,"Bonar Law , M_backed by fewer MPs than any of the other three contenders M_at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice ."
ew1-fragment01,18,"Robert Sanders reported the "" election "" meeting M_on 13 November M_with evident satisfaction :"
ew1-fragment01,19,The Carlton meeting M_on Monday M_went M_off quite admirably .
ew1-fragment01,20,Harry Chaplin M_in the chair a very M_great success .
ew1-fragment01,21,A good many men came into the room by no means M_inclined to acquiesce M_in the proposed M_arrangement .
ew1-fragment01,22,Walter Long proposed Bonar Law .
ew1-fragment01,23,His speech was one of the best M_things I have heard .
ew1-fragment01,24,M_Manly and rather touching .
ew1-fragment01,25,The country gentleman M_at his best .
ew1-fragment01,26,He spoke and evidently M_felt M_strongly of the degradation that it would have been M_to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot .
ew1-fragment01,27,Austen M_followed .
ew1-fragment01,28,When Austen sat down Chaplin suggested that he had better M_put the question at once and M_on M_getting an affirmative shout did so .
ew1-fragment01,29,A M_clever M_way of M_stifling discussion and few could have done it so well .
ew1-fragment01,30,M_Motion M_carried unanimously .
ew1-fragment01,31,Bonar Law then sent for ‰Û_
ew1-fragment01,32,His speech M_struck me as the M_feeblest of the day .
ew1-fragment01,33,He was evidently M_moved and nervous .
ew1-fragment01,34,The meeting M_separated M_in M_great content M_with the Conservative Party all M_round .
ew1-fragment01,35,It was certainly creditable .
ew1-fragment01,36,The urgency of the events M_following Balfour 's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader M_before the National Union Conference .
ew1-fragment01,37,"So M_within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues , Law 's leadership was M_ratified by the throng of party notables at Leeds ; here he received a reception more typical of what was to M_come M_in the future ."
ew1-fragment01,38,M_In 1911 Law was known ‰ÛÓ in so far as he was known at all M_in the parliamentary party ‰ÛÓ as a spirited debater .
ew1-fragment01,39,A. ) .
ew1-fragment01,40,"P. Taylor has M_noted that Law was M_trained , if he was M_trained for anything M_in his early career , to be a debater ."
ew1-fragment01,41,"In Glasgow he had M_picked M_up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have M_acquired M_in the Oxford Union or M_at the Bar , but skills that were very different M_in M_appearance ."
ew1-fragment01,42,His concern was solely M_with effectiveness rather than style ; he rarely spoke M_with more than M_brief notes and M_left it M_to the occasion to M_furnish the words .
ew1-fragment01,43,"( When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer M_this practice caused consternation M_at the Treasury , when he used only a page of notes to M_assist him M_in M_moving M_complicated resolutions M_on wartime finance ; he relied successfully M_on his memory to provide M_details and figures . )"
ew1-fragment01,44,As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words M_to his audience 's M_reactions and so M_convey the M_impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands .
ew1-fragment01,45,"M_In parliament he was wont to M_abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his M_point had been M_made ; the speeches that M_appear in Hansard were M_touched M_up by his staff , and his speeches in the country were given to the press M_in M_advance ."
ew1-fragment01,46,"M_In debate he was a formidable opponent , and one that Asquith was never able to master , for all his forensic skills ."
ew1-fragment01,47,Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy ; he was M_quick to M_grasp the M_essentials of an opponent 's argument and quite prepared to be M_rude or M_direct if the M_situation M_demanded it .
ew1-fragment01,48,"M_In the M_long debates M_over Marconi M_in 1913 and M_over the Curragh "" mutiny "" M_in 1914 Law was able to M_nail Asquith 's evasions M_where a more M_polished stylist might have been foiled ."
ew1-fragment01,49,"Occasionally , M_in the M_onrush of M_pursuit , he M_gave commitments that were later regretted , but M_these were a M_small M_price to M_pay ."
ew1-fragment01,50,"The Unionist M_recovery was M_built M_around Law 's leadership , but what Asquith called the "" M_new style "" of M_obstruction , threats and M_offensive behaviour did not originate M_with Law ."
ew1-fragment01,51,The beginnings are to be M_found M_in the diehard M_campaign M_against the Parliament Bill .
ew1-fragment01,52,"It was M_in June 1911 that the first M_scenes of disorder were M_mounted M_in the House of Commons , M_led by Lord Hugh Cecil ."
ew1-fragment01,53,"M_In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as M_violent as any that Law was to use later , and M_in the crucial decision M_on the House of Lords Law sided M_with the hedgers rather than the M_ditchers ."
ew1-fragment01,54,Ulster 's opposition M_to Home Rule long pre-dated Law 's leadership and he had rarely even spoken M_on Irish affairs M_in parliament M_before becoming leader .
ew1-fragment01,55,"Before he succeeded Balfour then , Law was not associated M_with any of the M_features that were to M_characterize his party leadership ; his M_contribution was to use the leadership M_in the M_service of all of M_these causes , to M_make himself the spokesman for the most M_spirited M_sections of the party ."
ew1-fragment01,56,Law conceived of the M_role of the leader M_in an exactly M_opposite M_sense M_from Balfour : he M_sought to M_foster unity by M_placing himself M_at the M_head of the M_discordant M_elements M_where Balfour had M_thrown the leadership M_on the M_side of M_restraint .
ew1-fragment01,57,"Their respective M_positions M_explain M_this in part : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure M_in his own right , Balfour M_had the confidence to believe M_in his own judgement even when M_isolated M_from the M_bulk of the party ; as the tertium quid M_in the recent contest , Law M_had neither the M_weight nor the confidence to M_take such a M_detached M_view ."
ew1-fragment01,58,"His M_strategy was rather to M_canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards M_into party M_channels , to M_articulate their M_views , and to create unity M_from the M_sense of M_movement ."
ew1-fragment01,59,"M_In his characteristic phrase , "" I am their leader , I must M_follow them "" ‰ÛÓ but he determined to M_follow them M_from the M_front ."
ew1-fragment01,60,"As a result of M_this he was M_labelled as a diehard and a bigot , when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots ."
ew1-fragment01,61,"Much of his leadership was thus a M_form of pragmatic extremism , M_extreme M_action and the threat of more extreme M_action to M_come , but used M_in the cause of more limited objectives ."
ew1-fragment01,62,"He certainly M_held M_deep M_convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the Liberal policies that he opposed , but at least a M_part of his apparent M_hostility was M_assumed for the occasion , a M_hard M_line that might M_secure a better compromise M_in the M_end ."
ew1-fragment01,63,So M_in his first major speech as leader M_in parliament he wasted little time M_on the customary compliments and M_warned the government that he intended to M_play M_hard .
ew1-fragment01,64,"M_In private conversation he told Asquith "" I am afraid that I shall have to M_show myself very M_vicious Mr Asquith M_this session ."
ew1-fragment01,65,"I hope you will understand . """
ew1-fragment01,66,"M_In later conversations M_about Ulster , Law was frank enough to M_point M_out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best M_way of ensuring an electoral M_landslide for the Unionists ."
ew1-fragment01,67,"There was then an M_open M_toughness M_about party M_tactics ; M_before the Buckingham Palace Conference M_in 1914 he M_had Central Office M_work M_out the electoral effects of M_excluding nine , six or four counties of Ulster M_from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot ."
ew1-fragment01,68,"M_From the party M_viewpoint Law 's methods were M_successful but M_dangerous ; expectations M_raised when the party was M_in M_full M_cry were not easily M_set M_aside for an eventual compromise , and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the M_recovery of M_power ."
ew1-fragment01,69,The basis of M_recovery was then Law 's M_fighting M_capacities as leader .
ew1-fragment01,70,M_In parliament there would be a carefully organized M_campaign of M_resistance that would at least M_slow the government M_down and M_raise Unionist morale .
ew1-fragment01,71,"Improved morale would also M_make possible organizational M_advances M_outside parliament , all M_linked M_to the issue of Ulster , and M_with the M_sights M_fixed M_firmly M_on the M_next election , an election that would M_make or M_break the Union , the Empire and Law 's leadership of the party ."
ew1-fragment01,72,"All was M_linked M_to the M_sense of a M_new M_departure , a "" M_new style "" , a "" M_new regime M_in politics "" and a new M_team M_at the M_helm : as well as a new leader , the party M_had M_by the M_middle of 1912 a new Chief Whip , Party Chairman , party treasurer , principal agent , press adviser , and an almost entirely new M_team of Whips and organizers ."
ew1-fragment01,73,Party organization provided the easiest M_advances because it was the only M_area entirely M_under the party 's M_control .
ew1-fragment01,74,"No general election was M_fought by the organization M_set M_up M_after 1911 , but there is little doubt that there was a M_massive improvement ; criticisms that were commonplace M_in 1910 were not to be M_heard M_by 1913 ."
ew1-fragment01,75,"The space available M_to Central Office was increased by the acquisition of St Stephen 's House as well as St Stephen 's Chambers , which had been occupied since 1874 ; the new office cost $3,000 a year M_in rent M_alone ."
ew1-fragment01,76,The quality of the M_senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists .
ew1-fragment01,77,"John Boraston took over as Principal Agent M_in 1912 , having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent M_to the Liberal Unionist Council ."
ew1-fragment01,78,"He M_joined William Jenkins , appointed chief organizing agent M_in 1911 and previously district agent for the Midlands Liberal Unionists ."
ew1-fragment01,79,The party was indeed M_handed M_over M_to Birmingham .
ew1-fragment01,80,"Finally , Malcolm Fraser , ex-editor of the Standard and of the Daily Express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to M_run the press bureau M_at the colossal salary of å£1,200 ."
ew1-fragment01,81,"Steel-Maitland , Boraston , Jenkins and Fraser made up a M_team of experts , all of sufficient status to M_deal M_with politicians who might call into the office ; the M_work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the M_heads of department M_brought M_together M_into a supervising board ."
ew1-fragment01,82,The influence of Central Office M_toned M_up the rest of the organization .
ew1-fragment01,83,A M_new canvass M_system was M_introduced M_in 1911 so that all county constituencies would M_operate the same M_system and so that duplicate records could be M_kept M_at M_area M_level .
ew1-fragment01,84,M_This was important M_at a time when outvoters were a larger M_group M_in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly Unionist .
ew1-fragment01,85,"M_In 1914 a register of car owners was compiled , also important when some voters could M_cast several votes M_in an election when polling M_went several days ."
ew1-fragment01,86,"M_By November 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in Great Britain were M_without candidates , a much better M_position than the M_position M_at dissolution M_in either 1909 or 1910 ; few of M_these fifty-one constituencies were winnable , but M_in any case most of them M_had candidates M_by the M_end of 1913 ."
ew1-fragment01,87,"A programme of speakers for a general election was also M_ready M_by 1913 , M_with both constituencies and politicians told M_in M_advance what they might M_expect ."
ew1-fragment01,88,The financial mismanagement that had M_reigned M_before 1911 was ended M_with the employment of professional accountants .
ew1-fragment01,89,"Expenditure M_on Central Office , district offices and the London office M_doubled M_from å£32,466 M_in 1909‰ÛÒ10 M_to $68,957 M_in 1913‰ÛÒ14 ; the total expenditure of the party organization M_from M_central funds also M_doubled M_from $73,000 M_to M_over å£150,000 ."
ew1-fragment01,90,"To pay for M_this outpouring , a M_great M_drive was M_mounted for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland ."
ew1-fragment01,91,M_In 1912 ordinary subscriptions still M_brought M_in only å£12000 a year and it proved difficult to M_raise them M_to anything like what was needed .
ew1-fragment01,92,"The method M_adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to M_bring M_in a M_regular income , and both Balfour and Law were used to M_raise the M_wind ."
ew1-fragment01,93,"Steel-Maitland told Balfour that "" Farquhar and I are endeavouring to M_raise more money ."
ew1-fragment01,94,I think we are likely to succeed ‰ÛÓ thanks in part M_to the very generous example M_set by Lord Rothschild .
ew1-fragment01,95,"But I would b , e very glad if I might see you M_on your return to ask you to help me M_in two cases ."
ew1-fragment01,96,"Systematic collections were M_made from peers and M_from the City ; M_by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted M_to $671,000 ‰ÛÓ twice the sum M_in 1911 and worth four years "" expenditure ‰ÛÓ and there was a special cash M_deposit of å£120,000 for the coming election ."
ew1-fragment01,97,"M_In three other M_areas , as much political as organizational , M_advances were M_made M_towards the management of the press , the M_coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party , and the M_fostering of modern M_attitudes M_in the local parties ."
ew1-fragment01,98,M_Under Malcolm Fraser the party M_began to M_make effective use of its M_support M_in Fleet Street .
ew1-fragment01,99,"It had been M_recognized that Liberals had been more adept M_at M_handling the press because they were more ready to M_stoop M_to newspaper practices , as Sandars had reported M_in 1909 :"
ew1-fragment01,100,"I told Northcliffe that if his people would M_make enquiries M_at our Central Office , he would M_find that our nightly M_regiment of speakers was at least as well M_worth reporting as the Radical M_contingent , but that I realized that M_from the Press M_point of M_view , no doubt , our speakers did not play up to the reporters by> M_handing them their speeches M_in M_advance , and by other tricks of the kind to which the Radical orators M_have recourse ."
ew1-fragment01,101,M_This was the M_essence of the problem : the press could only be M_managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to M_search for news .
ew1-fragment01,102,"The UOC M_found that "" it is patent that some M_feeling exists M_among the Unionist Press that , while M_in the past they have done much for the Party , the Party has not M_assisted M_in their work ."
ew1-fragment01,103,"M_In many M_quarters it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated M_with M_greater courtesy by the Radicals than by their own M_side . """
ew1-fragment01,104,"Fraser M_dealt M_with M_this problem M_without difficulty and explained M_to Law M_in 1913 that "" the importance of getting important speeches M_in M_advance is M_shown M_in M_concrete manner by your Wallsend speech M_on October 29th ."
ew1-fragment01,105,"The verbatim reports M_reached most of the newspapers in places such as Aberdeen M_at one o "" clock M_in the morning of the 30th . """
ew1-fragment01,106,He M_went M_on to quote the response that had been received from editors :
ew1-fragment01,107,Manchester Dispatch : I hope you will continue M_this M_form of enterprise .
ew1-fragment01,108,You fully know as an M_old pressman the difficulty of M_dealing M_with a M_big speech late M_at night ‰Û_
ew1-fragment01,109,Daily Express : I am much obliged M_to you for the precis of Mr Bonar Law 's speech last night .
ew1-fragment01,110,It was a M_great help M_to us .
ew1-fragment01,111,The speech M_came M_over the wires so late and the M_sheets were so confused by the Post Office ‰ÛÓ which is usual M_in M_these cases ‰ÛÓ that M_without the precis we could not possibly have got the M_leader through M_in time for the first edition .
ew1-fragment01,112,"So M_in the supply of information M_to newspapers M_predisposed to M_support the party , much was achieved merely by employing a specialist ."
ew1-fragment01,113,"The other M_side of press management , depending on informal M_contacts , is less easy to M_assess ."
ew1-fragment01,114,M_In 1911 Steel-Maitland invited Blumenfeld of the Daily Express to Central Office for a two-way M_exchange of ideas and advice .
ew1-fragment01,115,"He also used Law himself to M_impress editors who were M_on less familiar terms M_with Fraser , as M_with Marlowe of the Daily Mail , and Law M_took a M_direct interest M_in negotiations M_with the most difficult of all the Unionist editors , J. L. Garvin of the Observer ."
ew1-fragment01,116,"Law personally M_conducted the negotiations M_with Gardner Sinclair M_over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette M_in 1914 ; M_this negotiation also M_demonstrates that , as well as M_producing information and M_nursing editors , the party had to M_work M_hard to keep some of the newspapers M_in business ."
ew1-fragment01,117,"Sinclair did buy the Observer and the Pall Mall M_in the M_end , but not before he had been M_given a $45,000 guarantee M_from party funds ."
ew1-fragment01,118,"Such investments M_had a M_double purpose , for they could M_bring M_in income and provide a political M_bonus ."
ew1-fragment01,119,"One such scheme involved the purchase of the Daily Express by Max Aitken M_with party funds , but the party was also M_propping M_up the Globe , the Standard , and a M_wide M_range of provincial dailies ."
ew1-fragment01,120,"All M_these transactions were secret , for there would be little use M_in keeping a paper M_alive if it were known to be M_owned by a political party ."
ew1-fragment01,121,The papers were therefore bought M_through nominees or bank loans M_backed M_with party capital .
ew1-fragment01,122,It was usual to M_extract some M_form of guarantee M_in M_exchange for party M_support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings M_from being enforced .
ew1-fragment01,123,"Sinclair thus M_gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain Unionist , but Steel-Maitland doubted if such a promise M_had any M_value ."
ew1-fragment01,124,"The later history of the Daily Express M_suggests not : when the Express became M_hostile M_in the 1920s , Younger raged "" when I think of the M_large sum of money M_this office has M_put M_into M_that M_gutter print it M_makes my blood M_boil "" ."
ew1-fragment01,125,The M_justification for M_pouring M_out M_large sums M_without a certain M_return was the even M_greater cost of any real alternative .
ew1-fragment01,126,"The M_support for the Express M_in 1912 "" provides for the introduction of å£50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the Party M_possesses in London , and no less a sum than $700,000 M_to å£1 , 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the Daily Express were M_allowed to M_go ."
ew1-fragment01,127,"The M_struggle therefore M_went M_on to keep the Unionist press M_alive , and M_in 1912 and 1913 both Aitken and Northcliffe M_stood M_by the party and M_gave M_valuable M_support M_in their papers ."
ew1-fragment01,128,The M_coordination of competing party M_bodies was carried out M_with surprising ease .
ew1-fragment01,129,The National Union was merged M_with Central Office M_in 1911 and M_fusion M_with the Liberal Unionists M_followed M_in 1912 .
ew1-fragment01,130,Joseph Chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be M_overruled by Austen and by the overwhelming M_wishes of the Liberal Unionist Council to merge .
ew1-fragment01,131,"To M_cater for all susceptibilities , the party became the "" National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations "" ‰ÛÓ a decision that M_allowed some local parties to M_go M_on calling themselves Conservative , but the name "" Liberal "" was at last M_dropped ."
ew1-fragment01,132,The Liberal Unionists were M_admitted M_to the Carlton Club and a longstanding M_source of M_tension was eradicated .
ew1-fragment01,133,M_This was M_in itself a striking M_commentary M_on what had already been done : Liberal Unionists who had M_resisted amalgamation M_under Balfour and Acland-Hood M_in 1911 acquiesced meekly M_under Law and Steel-Maitland M_in 1912 .
ew1-fragment01,134,Other organizations could not be M_absorbed but could still be M_brought M_within the Central Office M_orbit .
ew1-fragment01,135,So M_in 1911 Steel-Maitland offered to M_join the Halsbury Club in order to M_guide it M_on M_to M_safer M_lines ‰ÛÓ and was M_immediately accused of disloyalty by Walter Long .
ew1-fragment01,136,Long helped though by M_placing both Steel-Maitland and Boraston M_on the Executive Committee of the Union Defence League for the same purpose .
ew1-fragment01,137,"Steel-Maitland also explained M_to Lord Robert Cecil that "" it has been M_arranged that the National Conservative Union should M_send M_out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations , such as the Tariff Reform League , the Anti-Socialist Union , the Primrose League , the London Municipal Society etc . """
ew1-fragment01,138,"The Central Office M_attitude was M_flexible , for M_outside M_bodies would always exist and could even be M_made use of :"
ew1-fragment01,139,"They M_represent a time when either their M_objects were not the same as M_those of the official organization , or the CCO was not M_enterprising enough to M_suit them ."
ew1-fragment01,140,But some caution should be M_observed .
ew1-fragment01,141,"It may be wise , while retaining or regaining M_control , to trade M_under different names ."
ew1-fragment01,142,"M_In some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained , M_in others M_full responsibility may be M_avoided ."
ew1-fragment01,143,"M_With M_open M_allies like the Primrose League , the case for collaboration was M_strong ; for the first time M_in thirty years of existence the Primrose League formally M_linked itself M_with the party M_in 1914 ."
ew1-fragment01,144,"M_On the other M_hand , the independence of the Tariff Reform League was a positive advantage : M_after January 1913 the party M_supported the tariff policy but was not including them M_in its M_immediate programme , so that Central Office could continue to M_distribute tariff propaganda M_from the TRL M_without compromising party policy ."
ew1-fragment01,145,"In general , efforts to ensure better M_coordination were a matter of the patient M_building M_up of M_contacts , although the improved party morale and the M_greater efficiency of Central Office had M_removed their M_justification for existence ."
fef-fragment03,622,3 .
fef-fragment03,623,M_Steady M_currents
fef-fragment03,624,3.1 .
fef-fragment03,625,The basic equations
fef-fragment03,626,M_IN M_this chapter we shall be concerned M_with phenomena M_in which the main M_role is M_played by the M_current of M_charged particles .
fef-fragment03,627,All our variables can be M_functions of space but are independent of time .
fef-fragment03,628,"It is easy to M_present the relevant equations ; we M_have all of eqns ( 1.1 ) -(1.7) but have to M_substitute a/at = O , M_yielding M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,629,There is a difficulty M_with eqn ( 3.6 ) .
fef-fragment03,630,"It is correct for most of the chapter M_with M_formula M_taken as a constant but M_breaks M_down for ferromagnetic materials , which will be discussed M_in M_Section 3.11 ."
fef-fragment03,631,All the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the M_simplest M_starting M_point for solving a given problem .
fef-fragment03,632,"We shall , therefore , M_introduce a number of alternative M_formulations ."
fef-fragment03,633,"First , we could M_search for some analogue of the M_potential M_function which proved so useful M_in electrostatics ."
fef-fragment03,634,"We M_found M_there that by choosing a M_scalar M_function M_in the M_form M_formula we could M_automatically M_satisfy the other equation for the electric M_field M_strength , M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,635,Can we do the same M_thing for the magnetic quantities ?
fef-fragment03,636,"No , but we can do a similar M_thing ."
fef-fragment03,637,"Since it is the equation M_formula that needs to be M_satisfied , we should choose the M_potential as a vector ( M_called , not M_without logic , the vector M_potential ) , M_defined by the equation M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,638,"M_Substituting the M_above equation M_into eqn ( 3.1 ) we M_get M_formula , or using the vector relation ( eqn ( A.6 ) ) we M_obtain the modified M_form M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,639,M_This equation can be M_further simplified M_to M_formula by choosing ( M_in the physicist 's jargon M_this is M_called choosing the M_gauge ) M_formula .
fef-fragment03,640,Can we do M_that ?
fef-fragment03,641,One ca n't usually M_assign some arbitrary M_value M_to the divergence of a vector M_function .
fef-fragment03,642,"M_In the M_present case , however , we do M_have some M_freedom of choice ."
fef-fragment03,643,The definition of A by eqn ( 3.8 ) is not unique .
fef-fragment03,644,"If we add M_to A the M_gradient of a M_scalar M_function , the resulting vector A' still M_gives the same magnetic M_field because M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,645,Hence a suitable choice of will ensure that M_formula .
fef-fragment03,646,So we are M_left M_with eqn ( 3.11 ) .
fef-fragment03,647,"If the M_current M_density is specified , eqn ( 3.11 ) will provide the solution for A M_from which B can be determined ."
fef-fragment03,648,How can we M_find a solution for A ?
fef-fragment03,649,There is nothing easier .
fef-fragment03,650,We only need to remember the differential equation for the M_scalar M_potential M_formula ( eqn ( 2.12 ) ) and its solution M_in the M_form of eqn ( 2.24 ) .
fef-fragment03,651,By analogy the general solution of eqn ( 3.11 ) is M_formula .
fef-fragment03,652,A M_simple M_integration will M_yield A if J is M_given .
fef-fragment03,653,We shall M_go M_through a number of examples later .
fef-fragment03,654,For the moment let us use the M_above M_expression for M_deriving Biot-Savart 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,655,"First we shall M_assume that the M_current M_density is confined M_to a thin wire M_in which case the M_integration variable may be changed M_to M_formula , M_where S is a vector normal M_to the cross-section , M_formula is the area of the cross-section , and dI is an elementary vector M_along the tangent of the wire ."
fef-fragment03,656,"Noting M_further that J.S = I and that I must be M_constant along the wire we may write eqn ( 3.15 ) M_in the modified M_form M_formula , whence the magnetic M_field M_strength is M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,657,We have to M_stop M_here for a moment to M_sort M_out the coordinates .
fef-fragment03,658,"As may be seen M_in Fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x' , y' , z' , whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic M_field are set of coordinates ."
fef-fragment03,659,Thus the M_curl M_operates M_on the coordinates of P but not M_on M_those of dl M_leading M_to M_formula M_where ir is the unit vector M_in the direction r and we have M_made use of the vector relation ( A3 ) M_in the Appendix .
fef-fragment03,660,M_This is Biot-Savart 's M_law M_derived M_directly M_from Maxwell 's equations .
fef-fragment03,661,Are there any other M_ways of determining the magnetic M_field ?
fef-fragment03,662,"Well , one can use eqn ( 3.1 ) as it is , but very often one is better off by using its integral M_form that can be M_obtained by M_integrating both M_sides of eqn ( 3.1 ) over a surface M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,663,"By M_using Stokes ' theorem for the M_left-hand-side and recognizing that the integral of the M_current M_density M_gives the M_current , the M_above equation M_reduces M_to M_formula , M_where the M_line M_integration is along the curve C enclosing the surface ."
fef-fragment03,664,The M_positive M_sense of the M_integration M_path is defined relative to the M_positive M_current direction according to the usual M_right-hand M_convention .
fef-fragment03,665,Equation 3.21 ) is known as AmpÌ¬re 's M_law .
fef-fragment03,666,We M_have now a number of equations M_describing the same thing .
fef-fragment03,667,"Which equation should we use M_in a practical case , the equation for the vector M_potential , AmpÌ¬re 's M_law , Biot-Savart 's M_law , or M_attack M_directly Maxwell 's equations ?"
fef-fragment03,668,It 's M_hard to M_tell .
fef-fragment03,669,"Experience M_with practical calculations M_helps , but even M_after years of work one usually M_remains M_this M_side of infallibility ."
fef-fragment03,670,I regret to M_say that there are no general guidelines available .
fef-fragment03,671,If one M_manages to M_find the M_simplest method M_at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed M_to good luck .
fef-fragment03,672,Can we claim M_then that the vector M_potential is as useful as its M_scalar counterpart M_in electrostatics ?
fef-fragment03,673,For computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no .
fef-fragment03,674,"It is always laborious to M_find the M_components of a vector , so we are not much better off M_with A than M_with H or B. It turns out however that A is a more basic M_quantity of physics than B. Since B is M_given by the M_curl of A it is possible that A is finite while its M_curl is zero ."
fef-fragment03,675,"Interestingly , M_under M_these conditions A M_has an effect M_on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena"
fef-fragment03,675a,"It would be unfair both M_to the vector M_potential and M_to quantum mechanics to M_say that none of M_those M_formulations M_have engineering M_applications ( M_in fact the most M_sensitive magnetometer built M_to date is M_based M_on M_that kind of theory ) , but by and large engineers would n't M_lose much sleep if the use of A were M_banned M_with M_immediate M_effect ."
fef-fragment03,676,"The vector M_potential is not a M_popular variable M_among engineers , maybe because it is not M_directly measurable ."
fef-fragment03,677,There are no instruments M_capable to measure the magnitude or direction of A.
fef-fragment03,678,M_In my opinion A is a useful thing if used M_with moderation .
fef-fragment03,679,"It M_helped us to M_derive Biot-Savart 's M_law , it will M_come M_handy later M_in solving certain radiation problems , and it often M_leads M_to M_nice M_formulae , e.g. for the magnetic M_flux crossing a surface , defined as M_formula that may be rewritten in terms of the vector M_potential as M_follows : M_formula M_where C is the curve enclosing the surface ."
fef-fragment03,680,We have now collected a M_good number of M_formulae which will M_serve us well M_in the M_following M_sections .
fef-fragment03,681,"M_Before M_going M_on , just a few words M_about the classification of M_steady M_currents ."
fef-fragment03,682,It may be M_roughly M_divided M_into two M_parts : magnetostatics and the rest .
fef-fragment03,683,"We shall discuss the rest first ( M_Sections 3.2‰ÛÒ3.5 ) , and M_that will M_give us some idea of the relative M_significance of electric and magnetic M_fields ."
fef-fragment03,684,"M_Sections 3.6‰ÛÒ3.16 are M_concerned M_with magnetostatics , M_where electric M_fields are M_assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of J , H , and B are M_studied ."
fef-fragment03,685,"Since we M_have so many variables , and since M_in each physical configuration only some of them M_appear , we will record ( just for M_this chapter ) the non-zero variables M_in each M_section heading ."
fef-fragment03,686,3.2 .
fef-fragment03,687,"The defocusing of an electron M_beam ( J , E , D , p , H , B )"
fef-fragment03,688,"We have so M_far talked M_about M_positive and M_negative M_charges , M_about M_point M_charges , and distributed M_charge ."
fef-fragment03,689,"I shall now M_introduce the concept of an elementary M_charge , 1.6 ÌÑ 10 -19 C , M_carried by an elementary particle M_called the electron ."
fef-fragment03,690,M_This is not a necessity .
fef-fragment03,691,"It is possible to M_study electromagnetic theory M_without ever mentioning the word electron , but since it has become such a M_household word and is used so often we can just as well M_make use of it ."
fef-fragment03,692,M_In the M_present M_section we shall M_consider a cylindrical electron M_beam of radius a in which the M_charge M_density is uniform ( p = Po ) and all electrons M_travel M_with velocity v.
fef-fragment03,693,We are not M_going to enquire M_into the details how such M_beams can be produced ( it belongs M_to the M_subject of physical electronics ) ; we shall accept the fact that the M_beam exists and will try to work out the M_forces M_on the outermost electrons .
fef-fragment03,694,"There is now cylindrical symmetry and a net M_charge per unit length M_formula , M_yielding for the radial M_component of the electric M_field M_formula ."
fef-fragment03,695,"The magnetic M_field may be M_obtained M_from AmpÌ¬re 's M_law ( eqn ( 3.21 ) ) as M_follows M_formula , M_where the M_line integral is M_taken M_over the circle of radius a ( Fig. 3.2 ) , I is the total M_current of the M_beam and M_formula is the azimuthal M_component of the magnetic M_field M_in the cylindrical coordinate system M_specified by M_formula] ."
fef-fragment03,696,M_From eqn ( 3.26 ) we M_get M_formula] .
fef-fragment03,697,The electric M_force M_on an electron of M_charge e M_travelling at the edge of the M_beam ( R = a ) is it is M_in the radial direction M_pointing outwards .
fef-fragment03,698,The magnetic M_force is perpendicular both M_to the direction of motion ( +z axis ) and the direction of magnetic M_field ( M_formula] direction ) .
fef-fragment03,699,The vectorial M_product v X B M_gives an inward M_force M_in the radial direction .
fef-fragment03,700,Hence the net M_force M_on the electron is M_formula] .
fef-fragment03,701,"Noting that M_formula] and anticipating the relationship M_formula] to be M_derived M_in M_Section 5.7 , we M_get the M_following M_formula for the M_force M_formula] , M_where c is the velocity of light ."
fef-fragment03,702,It may be M_seen M_from the M_above equation that the magnetic M_force is negligible in comparison with the electric M_force unless the velocity of the electron M_approaches the velocity of light .
fef-fragment03,703,"Thus the conclusion is that , owing to the repulsive M_forces between the electrons , a cylindrical electron M_beam is M_unstable ."
fef-fragment03,704,Using a M_technical M_term M_borrowed M_from electron optics we could M_say that the electron M_beam gets defocused .
fef-fragment03,705,The other conclusion ( as M_far as it is permissible to generalize M_from a single example ) is more important M_in principle .
fef-fragment03,706,It is M_concerned M_with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic M_forces .
fef-fragment03,707,Since M_charged particles rarely M_travel M_close M_to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic M_forces are by orders of magnitude M_smaller than the electric M_forces .
fef-fragment03,708,Why is it M_then that we M_have no difficulties M_in practice M_in observing magnetic M_fields ?
fef-fragment03,709,"The reason is , of course , that there are two kinds of electric M_charges and their effect usually M_cancels , so the small magnetic M_field M_has a chance of getting observed ."
fef-fragment03,710,And M_that M_brings us M_to the ext example .
fef-fragment03,711,"3.3 M_Pinch effect ( J , H , B )"
fef-fragment03,712,"M_In M_contrast M_to our previous example we shall now M_investigate a cylindrical M_beam consisting of two kinds of M_charge M_carriers : M_negative electrons and some M_positive particles , which I do not wish to be more precise M_about M_at the moment ."
fef-fragment03,713,We shall M_assume that the two kinds of particles M_have equal M_densities and move M_in M_opposite directions .
fef-fragment03,714,As a result there is no net space M_charge and hence no electric M_field .
fef-fragment03,715,"The M_currents , M_on the other M_hand , do not M_cancel because they represent M_opposite M_charges moving in M_opposite directions ( remember , minus one times minus one is equal M_to plus one ) ."
fef-fragment03,716,The magnetic M_field M_strength is M_given again by eqn ( 3.27 ) ; we only need to M_substitute for the M_current In + Ip M_where the subscripts n and p M_refer M_to M_negative and M_positive particles respectively .
fef-fragment03,717,"Hence the magnetic M_force M_on the electron at the edge of the M_beam ( at R = a ) is M_formula] , and M_on the M_positive particle is M_formula] ."
fef-fragment03,718,"Note that the M_force is inwards , and M_in the same direction for both particles ."
fef-fragment03,719,Let us distinguish two cases .
fef-fragment03,720,Both particles are mobile
fef-fragment03,721,M_In M_that case both of them will move inwards M_under the effect of magnetic M_force .
fef-fragment03,722,"But if the diameter of the M_beam is reduced , eqns ( 3.33 ) and ( 3.34 ) M_tell us that the M_forces are even M_larger ."
fef-fragment03,723,What happens M_then ?
fef-fragment03,724,If everything was uniform M_then the M_beam diameter would M_go M_on decreasing .
fef-fragment03,725,M_In practice however the M_beam is not uniform and does not M_possess perfect cylindrical symmetry .
fef-fragment03,726,"M_Under M_these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated , and of course our model is unable to M_predict the detailed M_behaviour of the particles ."
fef-fragment03,727,Nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be M_drawn M_without doing any M_further mathematics .
fef-fragment03,728,"If the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place , M_then the M_forces are M_larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections , so the M_beam will be M_further constricted , etc. , M_leading M_to the so-called M_sausage instability ( Fig. 3.3(a) ) ."
fef-fragment03,729,"If the magnetic M_field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side , M_then the M_beam will be deflected towards the M_weaker M_field which M_makes the M_field even M_weaker , etc. , M_leading M_to the so-called M_kink instability ( Fig. 3.3(b) ) ."
fef-fragment03,730,The M_positive particle is immobile
fef-fragment03,731,M_In practice M_this means that the M_positive ions are part of the crystal M_lattice .
fef-fragment03,732,"There is M_then no magnetic M_force M_on the ions , only M_on the electrons ."
fef-fragment03,733,So the electrons M_want to move inwards but can not because the ions M_hold them M_back by M_virtue of their electrostatic attraction .
fef-fragment03,734,"Naturally , if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well , i.e. owing to the magnetic M_force M_on the electrons , there is also an inward M_force M_upon the ions ."
fef-fragment03,735,So the whole crystal structure M_tries to contract or M_in other words the material is M_under pressure ( see Example 3.2 ) .
fef-fragment03,736,M_In any practical situation M_this pressure is M_small and can be neglected when calculating the M_forces M_on M_current-carrying M_conductors .
fef-fragment03,737,3.4 .
fef-fragment03,738,"M_Flow M_patterns and Ohm 's M_law ( J , E , D )"
fef-fragment03,739,M_Up M_to now we have not enquired M_into the question of how the M_current M_arose .
fef-fragment03,740,We just M_assumed that certain M_charge M_carriers moved M_with certain velocities .
fef-fragment03,741,"Now we shall M_say that M_in a class of materials the M_current M_density at any point is proportional M_to the electric M_field ; M_in mathematical M_form M_formula] , M_where M_formula] is the conductivity of the material ."
fef-fragment03,742,The M_above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely M_good guess .
fef-fragment03,743,It is valid for nearly all materials M_up M_to quite M_high electric M_fields .
fef-fragment03,744,Will there be a magnetic M_field ?
fef-fragment03,745,"Yes , of course , whenever there is a M_current there is a magnetic M_field as well ."
fef-fragment03,746,But the effect of the magnetic M_field M_upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible ( one exception causing the M_pinch effect is mentioned M_in the previous M_section ) .
fef-fragment03,747,Thus we may M_safely ignore the magnetic M_field when M_determining the M_lines of M_current M_flow .
fef-fragment03,748,"We are M_then M_left M_with only one equation M_formula] or M_formula] or M_formula] , depending on our preference ."
fef-fragment03,749,Eqn ( 3.38 ) M_tells us that there is some analogy ( see Example 3.3 ) M_with the electrostatic case treated M_in Chapter 2 .
fef-fragment03,750,"We may , M_in fact , reinterpret any of the diagrams of Figs ( 2.25 ) -(2.31) by M_assuming that the whole space is filled M_with a material of conductivity M_formula] and the M_field M_lines are now the M_lines of M_current M_flow as well ."
fef-fragment03,751,Is the analogy perfect ?

fet-fragment01,1,PROLOGUE
fet-fragment01,2,"Post-Impressionism : Royal Academy of Arts , London 1980"
fet-fragment01,3,"He signed the Friends ' Book M_in his elegant handwriting : Alexander Wedderburn , January 22nd , 1980 ."
fet-fragment01,4,"She had said , peremptory as always , that he was to go M_straight to Room III , where "" the miraculous stuff "" was to be found ."
fet-fragment01,5,Early .
fet-fragment01,6,"So here he was , a distinguished public man , also an artist of a kind , stepping obediently through Room I ( French 1880s ) and Room II ( British 1880s and 1890s ) , M_on a M_lead M_grey morning , to the M_pale grey , classical , M_quiet place where the bright light shone and M_sang M_off pigment so that the phrase , miraculous stuff , seemed merely M_accurate ."
fet-fragment01,7,"On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs , including an Arles "" Poets ' Garden "" he had n't seen M_before , but recognised , M_from small photographs , from charged descriptions M_in the painter 's letters ."
fet-fragment01,8,"He sat down and saw a bifurcated path , M_simmering M_with M_gold heat round and under the rising , M_spreading blue-black-green M_down-pointing M_vanes of a great pine , still widening where the frame interrupted its M_soaring ."
fet-fragment01,9,"Two decorous figures advanced , hand-in-hand , under its suspended thickness ."
fet-fragment01,10,"And beyond , green grass and geraniums like M_splashes of M_blood ."
fet-fragment01,11,Alexander was not worried M_about whether Frederica would turn up .
fet-fragment01,12,"She was no longer M_in the M_habit of being late : her life had M_schooled her M_to temporal accuracy , perhaps M_to being considerate ."
fet-fragment01,13,"He himself , M_at sixty-two , M_felt , not quite M_accurately , that he was now too old , too settled , to be M_put M_out , by her or by anyone else ."
fet-fragment01,14,He thought M_with M_warmth of her certain M_approach .
fet-fragment01,15,"There had been a M_pattern , an only too discernible repetition M_in the events and relationships of his life M_into which she had M_ruggedly refused to M_fit ."
fet-fragment01,16,"She had been a nuisance , a threat , a torment and was now a friend ."
fet-fragment01,17,"She had suggested that they look at Van Gogh together , M_setting M_up another M_form of repetition , deliberate , contrived and aesthetic ."
fet-fragment01,18,"His play , The Yellow Chair , had first been M_presented M_in 1957 ; he did not like to think too M_closely M_about it , as he did not like to think too M_closely M_about any of his past work ."
fet-fragment01,19,"He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes , a viridian impasto , a dense mass of M_furiously M_feathered M_lines of blue-green , isolated black pot hooks , the M_painfully M_clear orange-red spattering ."
fet-fragment01,20,He M_had trouble M_finding an appropriate language for the painter 's obsession M_with the M_illuminated material M_world .
fet-fragment01,21,"He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more M_accessible M_drama of the painter 's M_electric quarrels M_with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles , the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love , the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel , the asylum fears ."
fet-fragment01,22,"At first he had thought that he could write a M_plain , exact verse M_with no figurative language , M_in which a yellow chair was the thing itself , a yellow chair , as a round M_gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower ."
fet-fragment01,23,"Sometimes he still M_saw the brushstrokes , as it were , M_in M_this M_naked M_way , so that his earlier thoughts of M_this garden had to be M_undone , the idea of black wings to be M_stripped M_from the painted leafage , the vulgar idea of blood splashes M_washed M_off the notation of geraniums ."
fet-fragment01,24,But it could n't be done .
fet-fragment01,25,"Language was M_against him , for a M_start ."
fet-fragment01,26,"Metaphor M_lay M_coiled M_in the name sunflower , which not only turned towards but resembled the sun , the M_source of light ."
fet-fragment01,27,Van Gogh 's idea of M_things had also been M_against him .
fet-fragment01,28,"The yellow chair , besides being brushstrokes and pigment , besides being a yellow chair , was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the Yellow House , the white walls of which should M_blaze M_with sunflowers as the windows of Gothic cathedrals M_blazed M_with coloured light ."
fet-fragment01,29,"Not only metaphor : cultural M_motif , immanent religion , a faith and a church ."
fet-fragment01,30,One M_thing always M_linked M_to another M_thing .
fet-fragment01,31,"As the Poets ' Garden , a decoration for the bedroom of the "" poet Gauguin "" was more than it seemed ."
fet-fragment01,32,"Some time ago I read an article M_on Dante , Petrarch , Boccaccio and Botticelli ."
fet-fragment01,33,"Good Lord ! it did M_make an M_impression M_on me , reading the letters of M_those men ."
fet-fragment01,34,"Arles , 1888 ."
fet-fragment01,35,"And Petrarch lived quite near here in Avignon , and I am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders ‰Û_"
fet-fragment01,36,"There is still a M_great M_deal of Greece all through the Tartarin and Daumier part of M_this M_queer country , where the good folks M_have the accent you know ; there is a Venus of Arles just as there is a Venus of Lesbos and one still M_feels the M_youth of it , in spite of all ‰Û_"
fet-fragment01,37,"But is n't it M_true , this garden has a M_fantastic M_character which M_makes you quite able to imagine the poets of the Renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass ? ‰Û_"
fet-fragment01,38,"The M_youth of it , Alexander thought ."
fet-fragment01,39,I thought I was world-weary then .
fet-fragment01,40,"M_In July 1890 , two years M_after writing M_this , Van Gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin , and had died slowly ."
fet-fragment01,41,"M_In 1954 Alexander , a time-obsessed man , had read the centenary edition ( 1953 ) of the Letters ."
fet-fragment01,42,"He had himself been M_rising thirty-seven and when The Yellow Chair was M_put M_on had M_passed M_that age , was older now than Van Gogh , as he had , M_in the 1940s , realised that he was older than Keats ."
fet-fragment01,43,"He had M_felt , perhaps , briefly , the M_power of the M_survivor ."
fet-fragment01,44,What nonsense .
fet-fragment01,45,The eternal M_youth of Provence .
fet-fragment01,46,"He thought of thick , M_fat , hot motorways M_carving M_up M_that land ."
fet-fragment01,47,He M_turned his attention M_to the timeless fields of wheat and olives .
fet-fragment01,48,She M_made a kind of progress up the Palladian marble stair .
fet-fragment01,49,A painter stopped to kiss her : a journalist waved .
fet-fragment01,50,"John House , who had organised the exhibition , came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green M_tent-like coat ."
fet-fragment01,51,"He also kissed Frederica and introduced the woman , M_fumbling her name , as "" a colleague "" and Frederica as "" Frederica ‰ÛÓ you must forgive me , I never know what name you re working M_under , women M_these days are so protean . """
fet-fragment01,52,"Frederica did not attempt to ascertain the M_fumbled name , having given up interest M_in M_stray new people until it was M_clear that they were of real concern ."
fet-fragment01,53,She M_assumed wrongly that John House 's colleague was an art historian .
fet-fragment01,54,The colleague looked at Frederica M_with an apparently absent-minded M_scanning attention .
fet-fragment01,55,"John House spoke of the history of the M_gathering of the images , an emptiness here Jacob wrestling the Angel ) , an unexpected illumination there ."
fet-fragment01,56,Frederica listened attentively ; went on and signed the Visitors ' Book .
fet-fragment01,57,"Frederica Potter , Radio 3 Critics ' M_Forum ."
fet-fragment01,58,She M_negotiated a M_free catalogue .
fet-fragment01,59,She M_made her leisurely way towards where she had told Alexander to be .
fet-fragment01,60,"An old woman , M_armed with a Sound M_Guide , became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another ."
fet-fragment01,61,""" Hey ‰ÛÓ look at that ‰ÛÓ Winston Churchill painted that , the ‰Û_ "" ‰ÛÓ carefully ‰ÛÓ "" Cap d'Antibes . """
fet-fragment01,62,"Frederica M_dipped round her to stare : Claude Monet : "" Au Cap d'Antibes par vent de mistral "" ."
fet-fragment01,63,"A whirl of blue and rose , for in less formed plungings of water and wind ."
fet-fragment01,64,""" To paint , "" she remembered from Proust 's description of fictive Elstir , "" that one does not see what one sees . """
fet-fragment01,65,To paint light and air between ourselves and objects .
fet-fragment01,66,""" I said , dear , Winston Churchill ‰ÛÓ "" The second woman tugged free of the M_clutching fingers ."
fet-fragment01,67,""" Not to be mentioned M_in the same breath M_with ‰Û_ "" she said , looking nervously from Frederica to painted signature ."
fet-fragment01,68,The M_arrested water M_shone and M_danced .
fet-fragment01,69,M_In the catalogue John House quoted Monet 's description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks as an M_enveloping M_veil .
fet-fragment01,70,"He also quoted MallarmÌ© "" I think ‰Û_ that there should be only allusion ‰Û_"
fet-fragment01,71,"To name an object is to M_suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem , which is created by the M_gradual pleasure of M_apprehending it ."
fet-fragment01,72,"To M_suggest it , M_that is the M_dream . """
fet-fragment01,73,It was not a M_view of M_things M_with which Frederica was entirely M_in sympathy : she liked naming names .
fet-fragment01,74,"But she looked briefly down , M_dazzled by the M_flowing M_skin of worked and M_delicate colour ; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea , the prismatically M_sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks ."
fet-fragment01,75,"She scribbled words , notes , M_in the margin of her catalogue ."
fet-fragment01,76,"Daniel bought a ticket , and paid for the hire of a catalogue , he was n't sure why ."
fet-fragment01,77,"He had come , he believed , because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems M_with Frederica ."
fet-fragment01,78,He was aware that she believed he was in need of art .
fet-fragment01,79,Under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with M_that day 's headline : PEACE M_MOTHER DIES .
fet-fragment01,80,"He was M_raw M_to bad news , more M_raw as he grew older , which was not perhaps quite what he had expected ."
fet-fragment01,81,He saw and did not see the paintings .
fet-fragment01,82,"There was a field of poppies and corn which M_reminded him only of small and large , M_faded and M_ghostly versions of Van Gogh 's "" Harvest "" which he had seen M_repeated in endless hospital corridors , waiting rooms , school offices ."
fet-fragment01,83,"He had seen these ample fields , as he had seen Cezanne 's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room ."
fet-fragment01,84,"M_Odd , he thought , M_considering that Van Gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings ."
fet-fragment01,85,"Not serene , M_overexcited , these fields ."
fet-fragment01,86,Daniel 's patience M_with the nervously ill was not what it had been .
fet-fragment01,87,"Although he was fourteen years younger than Alexander , Daniel too was M_in the M_habit of thinking of himself as a M_survivor , a M_battered and M_grizzled M_survivor ."
fet-fragment01,88,Alexander saw her coming towards him .
fet-fragment01,89,"A dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed , hand-written , one-word-answerable questionnaires ."
fet-fragment01,90,"Alexander , always a connoisseur of garments , realised that Frederica had M_changed her style , that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a M_parody of the clothes Frederica had worn M_at their age , and that Frederica 's new style was not M_unrelated M_to M_this shift ."
fet-fragment01,91,"There she was in a conventional two-piece suit , fine M_dark wool , M_muted geometrical pattern M_in greens and unexpected straw browns , M_caught M_in at the waist ‰ÛÓ still very thin ‰ÛÓ to M_give the effect of a bustle , the skirt long and straight to the knee ."
fet-fragment01,92,"She had ruffles ( not swashbuckling ) at the neck and the small velvet hat could , but did not , support a veil ."
fet-fragment01,93,"The M_pale red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck , reminiscent of one of Toulouse-Lautrec 's fine-drawn cafe habituÌ©es ."
fet-fragment01,94,"Fifties and post-impressionist , thought Alexander , M_connecting ."
fet-fragment01,95,She M_came M_up and kissed him .
fet-fragment01,96,He remarked M_on the M_parody-young .
fet-fragment01,97,She M_took the M_point eagerly .
fet-fragment01,98,""" My dear , I know ."
fet-fragment01,99,"Pencil skirts and M_batwing sweaters and spiky stilettos , tottering M_with their hard little behinds sticking out , and all M_that red lipstick ."
fet-fragment01,100,"I remember when I thought lipstick had M_gone forever , a M_dream of painted excess , as I thought paper taffeta had M_gone forever , in Cambridge , when we all M_took M_to M_glazed cotton ."
fet-fragment01,101,"Do you remember ? """
fet-fragment01,102,""" Of course . """
fet-fragment01,103,""" Do you remember the eclectic Sixties M_parodies ‰ÛÓ when we went to the National Portrait Gallery ‰ÛÓ everything , M_from swamis M_to major-generals and major-domos too ."
fet-fragment01,104,These are such a M_serious and uniform M_parody .
fet-fragment01,105,More and more of the same .
fet-fragment01,106,"More of me . """
fet-fragment01,107,""" LÌ¬se-majestÌ© ."
fet-fragment01,108,And you ?
fet-fragment01,109,"You have reverted M_to type ? """
fet-fragment01,110,""" Oh , I 'm M_in my M_element ."
fet-fragment01,111,I understand the Fifties .
fet-fragment01,112,"I could n't do the Forties M_bit at all , padded shoulders and crÌ»py things , ugh , and M_pageboys ‰ÛÓ I think it must have been purely Oedipal , M_those were my parents ' M_things , dammit , what I was M_getting M_away M_from ."
fet-fragment01,113,"This is my M_scene . """
fet-fragment01,114,""" So it is . """
fet-fragment01,115,""" And now I have money . """
fet-fragment01,116,""" M_In our new austerity , you have money . """
fet-fragment01,117,""" M_In our new austerity , I am old enough to have money . """
fet-fragment01,118,They saw Daniel advancing .
fet-fragment01,119,""" Daniel does n't M_change , "" said Alexander ."
fet-fragment01,120,""" Sometimes I wish he did , "" said Frederica ."
fet-fragment01,121,Daniel did not M_change .
fet-fragment01,122,"He wore the same black clothes ‰ÛÓ baggy corduroys , heavy sweater , working-man 's jacket ‰ÛÓ that he had worn M_through the Sixties and Seventies ."
fet-fragment01,123,"Like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black M_fur had been extravagant , but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard , and his body was still compact and very heavy ."
fet-fragment01,124,"He looked , in M_this setting , a little like some M_painter ."
fet-fragment01,125,He saluted Frederica and Alexander with his rolled newspaper and said that it was cold outside .
fet-fragment01,126,"Frederica kissed him too , M_reflecting that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty , but M_in fact did n't ."
fet-fragment01,127,"Alexander smelled , still , of Old Spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness ."
fet-fragment01,128,His smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but M_shot now M_with M_needles of M_glittering M_silver .
fet-fragment01,129,""" We must talk , "" said Daniel ."
fet-fragment01,130,""" First you must look at the pictures ."
fet-fragment01,131,"M_Take time M_off . """
fet-fragment01,132,""" I keep trying ."
fet-fragment01,133,"I went to the King 's Carol Service . """
fet-fragment01,134,""" Good for you . """
fet-fragment01,135,Frederica glanced shrewdly M_at him .
fet-fragment01,136,""" Now , look at the pictures . """
fet-fragment01,137,"Gauguin 's "" Man with the Axe "" ."
fet-fragment01,138,""" One for you , "" said Frederica M_to Alexander , still M_skimming the necessary M_accompanying print ."
fet-fragment01,139,""" Androgynous ."
fet-fragment01,140,John House says .
fet-fragment01,141,"No , Gauguin said ."
fet-fragment01,142,"Do you think ? """
fet-fragment01,143,"Alexander M_considered the decorative M_gold body , itself a repetition of a body on the Parthenon frieze ."
fet-fragment01,144,"He saw a blue loincloth , flat breasts , purple sea with coral tracings M_lying flatly on it ."
fet-fragment01,145,"He was unmoved , though the colours were M_rich and strange ."
fet-fragment01,146,"He told Frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more M_obscured , more M_veiled , more suggested , and M_directed her attention M_to "" Still-Life , Fete Gloanec 1888 "" M_in which various inanimate objects , two ripe pears , a dense bunch of flowers , M_swam across a M_bright red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse ."
fet-fragment01,147,"The picture was signed "" Madeleine Bernard "" , and Alexander told Frederica that Gauguin had flirted seriously M_with M_that young woman , had characterised her , as was fashionable M_at the time , as M_having the desirable , unattainable androgynous perfection , complete sensuality M_combined M_with unattainable self-sufficiency ."
fet-fragment01,148,"Frederica informed him M_from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by Gauguin of Madeleine , the M_pears her M_breasts , the M_dense M_flowers her M_hair ."
fet-fragment01,149,""" You could M_read it another M_way , "" said Alexander , interested now , "" you could M_read the pears as M_androgynous M_in themselves , as partly M_male . """
fet-fragment01,150,""" And the hair as other hair , "" said Frederica loudly , scandalising a few bystanders , amusing a few more ."
fet-fragment01,151,""" You like to M_cork for your images , do n't you , Alexander ? """
fet-fragment01,152,""" It 's age , "" said Alexander , peaceably , untruthfully ."
fet-fragment01,153,"They were beginning to M_attract a M_penumbra of gallery-goers , as though they were offering a guided tour ."
fet-fragment01,154,"They moved on to the "" Olive Pickers "" ."
fet-fragment01,155,Daniel 's mind was M_elsewhere .
fet-fragment01,156,"He remembered a straight mass of M_red-gold hair , in cold King 's Chapel , more M_golden than M_foxy Frederica 's , slowly M_settling onto a collar as the pins M_released their M_grip ."
fet-fragment01,157,He M_saw a mass of freckles ‰ÛÓ sometimes M_melding M_into sixpenny-sized brown patches of M_warmth ‰ÛÓ M_moving over the M_hard M_frame of cheekbones and brow .
fet-fragment01,158,The M_sexless voices M_rose in the cold .
fet-fragment01,159,""" M_Unto us a Boy is born . """
fet-fragment01,160,""" Herod then M_with wrath was M_filled . """
fet-fragment01,161,"The voices M_played M_with the M_slaughter of the innocents , treble and descant M_hunting each other , while she bowed her head , unable to sing M_in tune ."
fet-fragment01,162,The olives had been painted M_from the asylum at St RÌ©my M_in 1889 .
fet-fragment01,163,"As for me , I tell you as a friend , I M_feel impotent when M_confronted M_with such nature , for my Northern brains were M_oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as I M_felt one ought to do better M_things M_with the foliage ."
fet-fragment01,164,"Yet I did not want to M_leave M_things alone entirely , M_without M_making an effort , but it is M_restricted M_to the expression of two things ‰ÛÓ the cypresses ‰ÛÓ the olive trees ‰ÛÓ let others who are better and more M_powerful than I M_reveal their symbolic language ‰Û_"
fet-fragment01,165,"M_Look M_here , there is another question that M_comes M_to mind ."
fet-fragment01,166,"Who are the human beings that actually live among the olive , the orange , the lemon orchards ?"
fet-fragment01,167,Frederica and Alexander M_held a discussion of natural supernaturalism .
fet-fragment01,168,"Daniel looked at the pink sky , the twisted trunks , the silvery leaves , the M_rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre , with pink , with M_pale blue , with red-brown ."
fet-fragment01,169,"Olives , Frederica agreed M_with Alexander , could not M_recall the Mount of Olives , the Garden of Gethsemane , M_in the day of Van Gogh the pastor 's son , the lay preacher ."
fet-fragment01,170,"As the cypresses must always , differently , M_mean death ."
fet-fragment01,171,"Daniel asked , for politeness really , why Van Gogh had been mad , was it just that he was driven ?"
fet-fragment01,172,"Alexander said that it may have been a M_form of epilepsy , exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbances of the mistral and the heat ."
fet-fragment01,173,Or you could M_make a Freudian explanation .
fet-fragment01,174,"He M_felt guilty M_towards the child who had not survived , for whom he had been named ."
fet-fragment01,175,He had been born M_on March 30th 1853 .
fet-fragment01,176,"His dead brother , Vincent Van Gogh , had been born M_on March 30th 1852 ."
fet-fragment01,177,"He was M_in M_flight M_from his family , his dead alter ego , his uncertain M_sense of identity ."
fet-fragment01,178,"He wrote M_to Theo , "" I hope you are not a "" Van Gogh "" ."
fet-fragment01,179,"Essentially I am not a "" Van Gogh "" ."
fet-fragment01,180,"I have always M_looked M_upon you as Theo Daniel said he could not M_see the M_pain Frederica said was M_in the olives , and Alexander , still lecturing , said that Vincent had objected M_to paintings of symbolic Christs in Gethsemane by Bernard and his compÌ¬res , had torn up his own , had M_made M_do M_with the olives themselves ."
fet-fragment01,181,"He told Daniel M_about the terrible St RÌ©my painting of the blasted tree , M_about noir-rouge , and Daniel said that it was M_odd that M_these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now , to cheer people up ."
fet-fragment01,182,"The trees M_stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes , small M_flying things , solidified light movements or saccades of the eye , brushstrokes , pigment ."
fet-fragment01,183,M_Here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me M_at the moment .
fet-fragment01,184,A view of the park of the asylum where I am staying ; on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house .
fet-fragment01,185,"Some deflowered rose bushes , on the left a M_stretch of the park ‰ÛÓ red-ochre ‰ÛÓ the soil scorched by the sun , covered with fallen pine needles ."
fet-fragment01,186,"M_This edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees , whose trunks and branches are red-ochre , the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black ."
fet-fragment01,187,"M_These high trees stand out M_against an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground , which higher up M_turns M_into pink , M_into green ."
fet-fragment01,188,"A wall ‰ÛÓ also red-ochre ‰ÛÓ M_shuts M_off the view , and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill ."
fet-fragment01,189,"Now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk , M_struck by lightning and sawed-off ."
fet-fragment01,190,But one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an M_avalanche of M_dark green pine needles .
fet-fragment01,191,"M_This M_sombre M_giant ‰ÛÓ like a M_defeated M_proud M_man ‰ÛÓ contrasts , when M_considered M_in the M_nature of a living creature , M_with the M_pale M_smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him ‰Û_"

fpb-fragment01,1169,"Three hours later , two thousand feet above the Mediterranean , Miranda , alert and exultant , sat next to her instructor at the controls of a trainer plane , an ugly little single-engine Rallye which her instructor described as efficient and M_forgiving : you could do something wrong m a Rallye M_without getting immediately M_punished for it ."
fpb-fragment01,1170,"Flying was even better than she had hoped : better than skiing , better than driving a sports car ."

fpb-fragment01,1178,"The instructor hesitated , then said , ‰Û÷ Why not ? ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1179,The girl was clearly a natural flyer .

fpb-fragment01,1181,The plane was now M_moving M_at not much M_above stalling speed .
fpb-fragment01,1182,"As the Rallye dropped to M_about thirty feet above the runway , Miranda throttled back completely and held the M_stick back ."

fpb-fragment01,1201,‰Û÷ You said three o'clock .
fpb-fragment01,1202,"It 's only two-thirty , ‰Ûª Buzz said ."
fpb-fragment01,1203,"‰Û÷ Ninety-three for you , two hundred and sixty-four for me ."
fpb-fragment01,1204,"M_That 's not a bad M_score for you , Nell . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1205,Buzz never cheated to let Elinor win : she knew that Elinor would immediately sense M_this and M_feel humiliated .
fpb-fragment01,1206,"M_After an intensive rehabilitation programme of physiotherapy and speech therapy , Elinor appeared to have completely recovered M_from her M_stroke , although she could no longer think of three M_things at once , which Buzz said was a mercy for the people who had to live with her ."
fpb-fragment01,1207,"Elinor was sometimes M_at a M_loss for the right word , or name , and then became impatient M_with herself ; she was often frustrated because she could n't move as swiftly as she did M_before ."
fpb-fragment01,1208,"M_At times , she was downhearted and wondered whether she would ever write another book ."
fpb-fragment01,1209,"‰Û÷ When you want to write , you 'll write , ‰Ûª Buzz would tell her then ."
fpb-fragment01,1210,"Now Buzz grunted , ‰Û÷ Look what I tore out of the Daily Mail . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1211,"She M_dug into her pocket , unfolded a bit of newspaper , and read , Sportsman Jim Clark today M_opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at Larkwood in Wiltshire , formerly the family home of the O'Dare family ."
fpb-fragment01,1212,"Lady O'Dare commented , ‰Û÷ I wish them well . ‰Ûª ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1213,‰Û÷ I doubt M_that . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1214,"Elinor peered at the photograph of the new owner , a motor-racing hero , standing with her sister-in-law , Marjorie ."
fpb-fragment01,1215,The doorbell sounded .
fpb-fragment01,1216,"‰Û÷ I 'll go , ‰Ûª Buzz said ."
fpb-fragment01,1217,‰Û÷ It 's either Adam or the postman . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1218,Buzz returned reading a postcard .
fpb-fragment01,1219,"‰Û÷ It 's for you , from Sonia Rushleigh ‰Û_"
fpb-fragment01,1220,"Whoops , I mean Bromley ."
fpb-fragment01,1221,Who 'd have thought them two would marry ?
fpb-fragment01,1222,"She says the Colonel 's taken up petit point , and Miss Hawkins is teaching him ."
fpb-fragment01,1223,"Remember her , the schoolmistress ? ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1224,"‰Û÷ I do indeed , ‰Ûª said Elinor ."
fpb-fragment01,1225,‰Û÷ Frumpy sourpuss !
fpb-fragment01,1226,Who 's the letter from ? ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1227,‰Û÷ Clare . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1228,Buzz held the envelope out to Elinor .
fpb-fragment01,1229,Elinor shook her head .
fpb-fragment01,1230,‰Û÷ You open it . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1231,‰Û÷ It 's marked personal . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1232,"‰Û÷ I do n't want to read it , unless she apologizes . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1233,Buzz opened the letter and read it .
fpb-fragment01,1234,She shook her head .
fpb-fragment01,1235,"‰Û÷ It 's just a M_friendly letter , M_asking how you are ."
fpb-fragment01,1236,"But reading M_between the M_lines , I think Clare needs money . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1237,"‰Û÷ If she took her M_poor child back to his father and M_gave her husband a second chance , she would n't need money . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1238,‰Û÷ How M_about a M_bit of generosity ? ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1239,Buzz said .
fpb-fragment01,1240,"‰Û÷ You 're a silly , stubborn old woman ."
fpb-fragment01,1241,And Clare 's just as stubborn and just as silly .
fpb-fragment01,1242,It would n't have M_hurt her to say she was sorry . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1243,Elinor looked anxious .
fpb-fragment01,1244,"‰Û÷ Do you really think she 's M_short of money , Buzz ?"
fpb-fragment01,1245,I would n't want her to M_have a M_rough time . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1246,"M_This remark was overheard by Adam as , in M_pale blue shirt and jeans , he sauntered through the door ."
fpb-fragment01,1247,"He said , ‰Û÷ Elinor , you allowed ample provision M_in the trust for helping Clare ‰ÛÓ if the trustees M_consider that help is needed ."
fpb-fragment01,1248,I 'll check M_on Clare when I get back to London . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1249,He put a pile of papers on a side table .
fpb-fragment01,1250,"‰Û÷ There 's rather a M_lot of paperwork here , M_things that you should be aware of . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1251,"‰Û÷ We 've had more paperwork , not less , since the trust took over , ‰Ûª Buzz said M_tartly ."
fpb-fragment01,1252,"‰Û÷ And I tell you frankly that I ca n't M_follow it , Adam ."
fpb-fragment01,1253,I thought the trustees were going to manage the business .
fpb-fragment01,1254,Elinor should n't be M_made to M_wade M_though pages of paragraphs M_with no commas M_in ‰Û÷ em . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1255,"‰Û÷ Of course the trustees manage the business , and they do it very well , ‰Ûª Adam said ."
fpb-fragment01,1256,‰Û÷ And there 's no reason for Elinor to see any of this if it tires her .
fpb-fragment01,1257,"M_In fact , I 'm M_about to suggest something that would simplify matters . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1258,‰Û÷ What 's M_that ? ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1259,Buzz asked .
fpb-fragment01,1260,"‰Û÷ I 'd like to substitute Paul Littlejohn for myself M_in the M_power of attorney that I M_hold M_on your behalf , Elinor ."
fpb-fragment01,1261,"I 'm trying to M_reduce the number of business administrators : the fewer there are , the simpler the M_system and the cheaper it will be . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1262,"‰Û÷ Does M_that M_mean that Paul will be legally responsible for Elinor 's affairs instead of you , Adam ? ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1263,"‰Û÷ Yes , but M_that 's only a technicality ."
fpb-fragment01,1264,Paul will do as I say .
fpb-fragment01,1265,"And I 'd also like you to sign this document , Adam M_added , ‰Û÷ which M_absolves me and STG M_from any further responsibility once Paul Littlejohn has been substituted . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1266,"Buzz said , ‰Û÷ But surely ‰Û_ ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1267,"M_Smoothly Adam explained , ‰Û÷ The responsibility must clearly M_rest M_m only one M_area ."
fpb-fragment01,1268,It 's M_in your interests to M_clarify the M_situation .
fpb-fragment01,1269,It 's customary . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1270,"‰Û÷ If you think M_that 's best , Adam dear . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1271,Elinor frowned slightly M_at Buzz .
fpb-fragment01,1272,"Adam decided to M_hold M_back Miranda 's bombshell until later , after Elinor drank her evening glass of champagne ."
fpb-fragment01,1273,"Just M_before five o'clock , when the business session had ended and the afternoon was still hot , M_quiet , and M_heavy M_with languor , Buzz left to get some tea ."
fpb-fragment01,1274,"Adam escorted Elinor to the elevator ; M_after taking her to her bedroom , he intended to go to the beach for a swim ."
fpb-fragment01,1275,"In the high-ceilinged kitchen , surrounded by the smells of mint and basil , Buzz whistled ‰Û÷ Roses of Picardy ‰Ûª M_with much M_dramatic M_warbling as she prepared Elinor 's tea ."
fpb-fragment01,1276,"Leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window , while the bottom was covered by M_aggressive pink hollyhocks , seemingly M_determined to M_fight their M_way inside ."
fpb-fragment01,1277,"Sylvie , the cook , sat at the big kitchen table by the window , writing a list and shooing pigeons away ."
fpb-fragment01,1278,The bane of Sylvie 's life was the pigeon droppings that littered the windowsill and had to be cleaned up daily .
fpb-fragment01,1279,"M_With a shudder , Sylvie refused a cup of tea ."
fpb-fragment01,1280,"Still whistling , Buzz laid the tray ."
fpb-fragment01,1281,The soporific M_calm of the M_drowsy afternoon was M_shattered by the bell indicator above the kitchen door .
fpb-fragment01,1282,Someone was jabbing the bell ‰ÛÓ non-stop ‰ÛÓ in Elinor 's bedroom .
fpb-fragment01,1283,"Knowing that Adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach , Buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs ."
fpb-fragment01,1284,Frantically she M_tore open the door to Elinor 's apartment .
fpb-fragment01,1285,"In the passage , she stumbled and almost fell , then flung back the door to the bedroom ."
fpb-fragment01,1286,"M_To her M_relief , Elinor was not slumped on the floor ; deathly white , she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed ."
fpb-fragment01,1287,"Wordlessly , she pointed above the fireplace ."
fpb-fragment01,1288,"Buzz turned her head to the left , where the portrait of the three sisters hung ."
fpb-fragment01,1289,"At first Buzz saw nothing , but then she gasped M_in horror ."
fpb-fragment01,1290,"Each of the three long , M_creamy necks had been cut horizontally : a small triangle of canvas hung downward from each slashed throat ."
fpb-fragment01,1291,18
fpb-fragment01,1292,"WEDNESDAY , 17 AUGUST 1966"
fpb-fragment01,1293,"In the foyer of the Clanrickard Club , Mike Grant leaned against the wall at the bottom of a double-sided curving staircase ."
fpb-fragment01,1294,"M_With his hands in the pockets of his dinner jacket , he M_surveyed the room ."
fpb-fragment01,1295,"It was going to be a good night , in spite of the fact that it was August and a Wednesday ."
fpb-fragment01,1296,"M_Making sure to appear casual , he carefully watched the men in dinner jackets and the women in full-length dÌ©colletÌ© dresses move slowly over the red carpet towards the restaurant at the rear , or climb the staircase to the gaming rooms ."
fpb-fragment01,1297,"Mike noticed a group of M_heavy gamblers , most of them Greek , move towards the baccarat room , where the Sultan of Rupolei had been losing for the last hour ."
fpb-fragment01,1298,"His attention was also M_caught by a woman dressed in midnight-blue satin and diamonds ; the sister of a Middle-Eastern M_ruler , she was known as an audacious gambler ."
fpb-fragment01,1299,"He stiffened as he recognized a man move upstairs M_with a distinctive , M_boneless saunter : he had better send someone up to check the backgammon room ."
fpb-fragment01,1300,"The club owners , the casinos , and the multinational bookmakers M_knew which professional gamblers successfully played games that M_contained an M_element of skill ‰ÛÓ such as backgammon and poker- and they preferred to M_have nothing to do M_with them ; ideally , the house M_welcomed inexperienced , rich idiots ."
fpb-fragment01,1301,‰Û÷ M_This is certainly a good night to play the odds . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1302,Mike heard a sarcastic voice from behind him .
fpb-fragment01,1303,He turned and smiled M_at Adam .
fpb-fragment01,1304,‰Û÷ Come into my office for a drink .
fpb-fragment01,1305,What 's M_up ? ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1306,"In Mike 's office , furnished with heavily varnished Victorian club furniture ."
fpb-fragment01,1307,Adam shook his head curtly M_at the offer of a chair .
fpb-fragment01,1308,"‰Û÷ I 'm not staying , ‰Ûª he said ."
fpb-fragment01,1309,‰Û÷ I merely wanted to tell you that you 've scared the M_hell M_out M_of everyone at Saracen ‰ÛÓ except me .
fpb-fragment01,1310,"So kindly curb your M_theatrical , James Bond M_streak ."
fpb-fragment01,1311,"I knew immediately what your message M_meant : ‰Û÷ If you do n't pay up , one slash is all it M_takes . ‰Ûª ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1312,He M_glared M_at his brother .
fpb-fragment01,1313,‰Û÷ I thought you were fond of Elinor .
fpb-fragment01,1314,I seem to M_recall that Elinor helped you to buy your first good bike .
fpb-fragment01,1315,Why M_drag her M_into my problems ?
fpb-fragment01,1316,You might have M_given her another M_stroke . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1317,"‰Û÷ I do n't know what the M_hell you 're talking M_about , and I ca n't comment until I do . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1318,"Mike , his face M_alert and M_wary , lit a cigarette ."
fpb-fragment01,1319,"Adam briefly described how the triple portrait had been slashed and M_added , ‰Û÷ D' you really expect me to believe that you M_had nothing to do M_with it ?"
fpb-fragment01,1320,Someone told some cat burglar where to find M_that picture ! ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1321,"Mike stared at his brother , then slowly said , ‰Û÷ Not me ."
fpb-fragment01,1322,"I agree , it 's clearly a warning to pay , but I swear I know nothing M_about it ."
fpb-fragment01,1323,It could n't have been the brothers ‰ÛÓ they 'd be even less subtle ‰Û_ ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1324,He inhaled deeply .
fpb-fragment01,1325,"‰Û÷ Who else do you owe money , Adam , you stupid M_bastard ? ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1326,‰Û÷ No one who 'd do anything so bloody childish !
fpb-fragment01,1327,How do I stop M_this M_bloody nonsense ? ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1328,"‰Û÷ How many times must I tell you that if you M_let M_things M_go too M_far , nobody can stop what will undoubtedly happen ?"
fpb-fragment01,1329,"Adam , ‰Ûª Mike M_went M_on quietly , ‰Û÷ you 've always M_taken M_full advantage of anyone who 's fond of you ."
fpb-fragment01,1330,You think you can push me around because you 've been doing M_that since we were M_in the nursery .
fpb-fragment01,1331,You also grew up watching Grandfather 's clients literally M_get M_away M_with murder . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1332,"He sucked on his cigarette , furiously threw it into the fireplace , shoved his hands in his pockets , and M_glared M_at Adam ."
fpb-fragment01,1333,‰Û÷ Do you want to be found washed up on the seashore M_with a few vital bits missing ?
fpb-fragment01,1334,"Are you so anxious to know what it feels like to M_have both eyeballs gouged out , one M_at a time ?"
fpb-fragment01,1335,"Do you want to be slowly battered M_to death , M_before dying M_in agony ? ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1336,"‰Û÷ Of course not , you M_bastard , ‰Ûª Adam said ."
fpb-fragment01,1337,‰Û÷ I only want to know who slashed M_that picture if you did n't . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1338,‰Û÷ Whoever they are ‰ÛÓ and only you know M_that ‰ÛÓ M_these people are serious .
fpb-fragment01,1339,Punters often try to M_avoid paying .
fpb-fragment01,1340,Examples often have to be M_made .
fpb-fragment01,1341,You know M_that . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1342,Mike started to stride M_up and M_down the room .
fpb-fragment01,1343,"‰Û÷ M_Take M_that fucking urbane look M_off your face and M_face reality , Adam ."
fpb-fragment01,1344,"If you M_lose money , M_that 's M_tough ."
fpb-fragment01,1345,"But if you do n't pay up , M_that 's insanity . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1346,"‰Û÷ I 've M_had enough of your M_melodrama , ‰Ûª Adam M_snarled ."
fpb-fragment01,1347,Mike M_glared M_at his brother again .
fpb-fragment01,1348,‰Û÷ I 'm not exaggerating .
fpb-fragment01,1349,"Remember M_that incident when the Sultan 's sister had her Rolls stopped , M_at two M_in the morning on the Grande Corniche , M_after leaving the casino ?"
fpb-fragment01,1350,They M_blew away the chauffeur 's head with a machine gun .
fpb-fragment01,1351,She was n't touched .
fpb-fragment01,1352,She paid all her gambling debts the very M_next day .
fpb-fragment01,1353,"And when the story was carefully M_leaked M_to the newspapers , quite a M_lot of other debts were suddenly M_settled in full . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1354,‰Û÷ I 'm not some goddamned sultan 's sister . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1355,"‰Û÷ No , but you also like M_playing M_with M_fire ."
fpb-fragment01,1356,You never believe that the gods will really let it M_burn you .
fpb-fragment01,1357,You think you 're omnipotent ‰ÛÓ but you are n't . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1358,"‰Û÷ M_Keep your voice M_down , ‰Ûª Adam M_growled ."
fpb-fragment01,1359,"‰Û÷ I 'll do what I bloody well like in my own office , ‰Ûª Mike said ."
fpb-fragment01,1360,‰Û÷ Do n't you understand ?
fpb-fragment01,1361,"I 'm M_on your M_side , Adam ."
fpb-fragment01,1362,You 're the only brother I M_have . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1363,His voice M_deepened .
fpb-fragment01,1364,‰Û÷ I 'm probably more worried M_about M_this than you are .
fpb-fragment01,1365,If anything happened M_to you ‰Û_
fpb-fragment01,1366,I 'd be M_left M_without you .
fpb-fragment01,1367,"So for God 's sake , pay up , you stupid M_shit !"
fpb-fragment01,1368,"Do n't think you can M_get M_away M_with it just because you 've always M_got M_away M_with everything , since you M_set M_that nursemaid 's apron alight . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1369,"‰Û÷ I thought you were too young to remember M_that , ‰Ûª Adam said uneasily ."
fpb-fragment01,1370,"He M_added , ‰Û÷ She should n't have left the matches within reach of a child . ‰Ûª"
fpb-fragment01,1371,"‰Û÷ She was in hospital for six weeks , and I was the only one who knew it was n't an accident ."
fpb-fragment01,1372,I knew you wanted to M_see how M_far you could M_go . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1373,"‰Û÷ Let's not argue M_about something that happened M_over thirty years ago , ‰Ûª Adam said finally ."
fpb-fragment01,1374,‰Û÷ Can you M_raise money to help me fend them off ?
fpb-fragment01,1375,I promise you .
fpb-fragment01,1376,M_within six months I know I 'll M_have no more money problems .
fpb-fragment01,1377,Never again . ‰Ûª
fpb-fragment01,1378,"‰Û÷ You 'll M_have money problems as long as you gamble , Adam ."
fpb-fragment01,1379,"Annabel was determined to M_get a M_grip M_on herself and do as Scott advised : remember 1965 as the year she stopped having to go to auditions and 1966 as the year M_in which she M_blossomed M_into a successful young New York hostess as she met Andy Warhol , Lenny Bernstein , Baby Jane Holzer , and all the other gossip-columnist M_fodder ."
fpb-fragment01,1380,"M_By July , Annabel was a Junior Friend of the Metropolitan Museum , a Friend of the Museum of Modern Art , and a patron of the Bronx Zoo ."
fpb-fragment01,1381,"She also allayed her insecurity M_with a M_massive spending spree ; each charity dinner required a new ballgown , and each new M_glittering friend ‰ÛÓ M_contacts for Scott ‰ÛÓ required a M_glittering party ."
fpb-fragment01,1382,So the year thus M_far was a busy one .
g0l-fragment01,1,The M_Long M_Road M_Home
g0l-fragment01,2,CIA M_HQ Langley
g0l-fragment01,3,Sorge had never been to Langley before .
g0l-fragment01,4,It was not something a Russian expected to do .
g0l-fragment01,5,"It was M_after 9 a.m. when Nowak drove him through the gates , past the guards , and into the vast underground car-park ."
g0l-fragment01,6,‰Û÷ Why Langley ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,7,Sorge had asked him on the way out of Washington .
g0l-fragment01,8,‰Û÷ They want to M_show you that they trust you . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,9,‰Û÷ I do n't expect I 'll see much . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,10,Nowak laughed .
g0l-fragment01,11,‰Û÷ Damn right .
g0l-fragment01,12,"We park in the underground car-park , M_catch a special lift to the fifth floor and walk across the corridor into a special conference room . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,13,‰Û÷ M_That 's trust ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,14,‰Û÷ M_That 's trust . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,15,The Executive Director was already in the meeting room .
g0l-fragment01,16,‰Û÷ Welcome to Langley . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,17,He held his hand out M_in welcome .
g0l-fragment01,18,"When the introductions were complete , the Exec Director , the DDA , the DDI , Sorge and Nowak settled themselves round the small conference table ."
g0l-fragment01,19,"‰Û÷ We M_have a M_new problem , ‰Ûª M_kicked M_off the Exec Director ."
g0l-fragment01,20,‰Û÷ The English operative who was guarding Trimmler has taken off .
g0l-fragment01,21,He 's also taken an agent of ours with him .
g0l-fragment01,22,As hostage .
g0l-fragment01,23,A woman .
g0l-fragment01,24,We believe they 're still in New Orleans . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,25,"‰Û÷ Why ? ‰Ûª asked Sorge , concerned ."
g0l-fragment01,26,‰Û÷ I do n't know yet .
g0l-fragment01,27,What M_about Goodenache ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,28,He decided to M_turn the M_pressure M_on the Russian .
g0l-fragment01,29,‰Û÷ He M_caught a flight to Frankfurt .
g0l-fragment01,30,"he hired a car , but the car was found abandoned on the outskirts of Frankfurt ."
g0l-fragment01,31,We are trying to find our missing scientist now . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,32,‰Û÷ Are the German authorities M_involved ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,33,‰Û÷ No .
g0l-fragment01,34,We M_have our own M_means . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,35,"Sorge saw the Exec Director look up , his eyebrows M_raised suddenly ."
g0l-fragment01,36,‰Û÷ We both M_have our methods .
g0l-fragment01,37,Even in an independent Germany .
g0l-fragment01,38,"M_After all , it was the death of our people M_in M_these M_situations that has M_brought us together . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,39,The Exec Director shrugged .
g0l-fragment01,40,M_Bastard Russians were still M_upM_to their M_old M_tricks .
g0l-fragment01,41,He ignored the M_pointed look the DDI was M_giving him .
g0l-fragment01,42,‰Û÷ I thought it best if the Director of our operations in New Orleans M_gave you a run down of what has M_taken M_place up to now . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,43,"He sat back and let the DDA M_give a M_full report , including the M_trip to the voodoo ceremony and all that M_followed ."
g0l-fragment01,44,"Sorge did n't stir , even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of Trimmler 's arms M_folded M_in the sign of a swastika ."
g0l-fragment01,45,‰Û÷ We still are n't convinced that Trimmler 's death M_has anything to M_do M_with the death of our agents .
g0l-fragment01,46,There 's no definite M_link . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,47,‰Û÷ The M_situation might be M_clearer when I 've finished . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,48,"Sorge looked round the table , saw their undisguised curiosity ."
g0l-fragment01,49,"‰Û÷ M_In 1942 , in Germany , we M_had a GRU M_network named the Rote Kapelle ‰Û_ ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,50,‰Û÷ What 's M_that ? ‰Ûª asked the Exec Director .
g0l-fragment01,51,‰Û÷ Red M_Orchestra .
g0l-fragment01,52,The Nazis called it M_that because we M_had radio operators we code-named musicians .
g0l-fragment01,53,"Their leader , the Chef , we called him , was Leopold Trepper ."
g0l-fragment01,54,"It was M_this group that radioed the warning of Operation Blue , the attack on Stalingrad that M_led M_to Hitler 's M_biggest wartime disaster M_on the Russian M_Front . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,55,‰Û÷ Who was M_feeding you all M_this information in Germany ? ‰Ûª asked the Exec Director .
g0l-fragment01,56,‰Û÷ High-ranking officials .
g0l-fragment01,57,Both M_in the military and M_in the Government .
g0l-fragment01,58,They M_saw the M_damage Hitler was doing .
g0l-fragment01,59,"They did n't disagree M_with his M_aims , only his methods ."
g0l-fragment01,60,"When they M_saw that the war could not be won , even as early as 1941 , some of them M_opened M_up M_lines of communication M_with us and the British . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,61,"‰Û÷ We did n't M_get M_that sort of M_stuff M_till late M_into 1944 , ‰Ûª said the DDA ."
g0l-fragment01,62,‰Û÷ You were n't Europeans .
g0l-fragment01,63,We M_had centuries of M_contacts to fall back on .
g0l-fragment01,64,"For all their bravery and resourcefulness , their information was often wasted , because Stalin did n't believe them ."
g0l-fragment01,65,"But then , he M_found it difficult to believe anyone ."
g0l-fragment01,66,"The Germans , with more M_sophisticated radio-tracking equipment , started to track down the M_musicians ."
g0l-fragment01,67,Even Trepper was captured and the Rote Kapelle was wound up M_at the M_end of 1942 .
g0l-fragment01,68,"Our information continued for a while , but it was of M_doubtful origin ."
g0l-fragment01,69,"Trepper was interrogated by the Gestapo and we believed he became a M_double agent , a M_lot of misinformation was received in Moscow . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,70,Sorge leant across and finished his coffee M_before continuing .
g0l-fragment01,71,‰Û÷ But we still needed information .
g0l-fragment01,72,The overall M_network M_with M_sources inside Germany was the Rote Drei . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,73,"‰Û÷ The Red what ? ‰Ûª said the Exec Director , pleased that he had deciphered the first word of the M_new code-name ."
g0l-fragment01,74,‰Û÷ Three .
g0l-fragment01,75,The Red Three .
g0l-fragment01,76,Based in Switzerland and named M_after the three transmitters that they used .
g0l-fragment01,77,"The most important M_source of information , M_from agents inside Germany , was M_from a group M_under Rudolf Roessler ."
g0l-fragment01,78,"His code-name was M_Lucy and his M_network , the M_Lucy M_Ring ."
g0l-fragment01,79,"Roessler , or Lucy , was a Swiss Intelligence Officer of German extraction ."
g0l-fragment01,80,He M_had many M_contacts in Germany .
g0l-fragment01,81,"Lucy 's four M_main M_contacts were Major General Oster who was the M_head of the Abwehr ; Admiral Canaris who was later hanged for his M_part M_in the 1944 bomb M_plot ; Carl Goehdeler who was leader of the official opposition M_to Hitler ; and Colonel Boetzel , the commanding officer of Intelligence Evaluation ."
g0l-fragment01,82,"There were others , but Lucy never M_disclosed any of them M_to us . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,83,‰Û÷ Even M_after the war ? ‰Ûª asked the DDI .
g0l-fragment01,84,"‰Û÷ The Lucy Ring was disbanded M_in 1943 , M_after being M_responsible for some invaluable work ."
g0l-fragment01,85,"I wo n't M_go M_through all their successes , but it was M_substantial ."
g0l-fragment01,86,The British were involved M_with them M_through us and it was their advanced work M_on M_breaking cyphers that enabled the M_ring to establish such a M_great record .
g0l-fragment01,87,"But the ring disbanded , once more because of Stalin 's penchant for secrecy , after Moscow M_tried to M_bypass Roessler and M_go M_direct M_to his Number Two . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,88,"‰Û÷ So , M_where 's the M_link ? ‰Ûª interrupted the DDA , impatient as ever ."
g0l-fragment01,89,"‰Û÷ It 's important you understand the M_background , ‰Ûª said Sorge , not allowing the American to M_get M_under his M_skin ."
g0l-fragment01,90,‰Û÷ Nothing M_further M_came M_from the ring M_until the last few weeks of the war .
g0l-fragment01,91,"M_With the Allies advancing M_on the Eastern and Western M_fronts , many high-ranking Germans were M_out to save their own necks ."
g0l-fragment01,92,"The Lucy Ring was reactivated , M_this time M_without the knowledge of the British . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,93,"‰Û÷ Or the Americans , ‰Ûª commented the Exec Director ."
g0l-fragment01,94,"‰Û÷ I suggest you M_take M_that M_up M_with Comrade Stalin , ‰Ûª replied Sorge drily ."
g0l-fragment01,95,‰Û÷ It was an impressive M_list .
g0l-fragment01,96,They did n't just M_have knowledge .
g0l-fragment01,97,They also had wealth .
g0l-fragment01,98,M_In all M_forms .
g0l-fragment01,99,"Art , cash , M_in every M_form possible ."
g0l-fragment01,100,They used the ring because of their M_line M_into Switzerland .
g0l-fragment01,101,They wanted the security of the Swiss banks and the Russian M_Bear .
g0l-fragment01,102,One was dependent M_on the other . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,103,‰Û÷ So they M_bought M_immunity .
g0l-fragment01,104,"While our boys were still getting killed , ‰Ûª M_snapped the DDI ."
g0l-fragment01,105,"‰Û÷ As were ours , ‰Ûª M_snapped M_back Sorge ."
g0l-fragment01,106,‰Û÷ But your M_hands were n't M_that M_clean .
g0l-fragment01,107,You were bringing scientists and others into America just as we were .
g0l-fragment01,108,"Scientists M_with Nazi records , scientists M_with a history of brutality , war criminals . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,109,"‰Û÷ Gentlemen , please , ‰Ûª said Nowak , ever the diplomat ."
g0l-fragment01,110,‰Û÷ Can we just M_stick M_to what we 're here to discuss ?
g0l-fragment01,111,"M_Go M_on , Dimitri . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,112,"Sorge was annoyed M_with himself , M_irritated that he had allowed the Intelligence man to M_get M_under his M_skin ."
g0l-fragment01,113,"‰Û÷ Of course , ‰Ûª he smiled M_back ."
g0l-fragment01,114,"‰Û÷ Now ‰Û_ ah , yes ‰Û_ we used the Lucy Ring ."
g0l-fragment01,115,"Many Germans , with their prizes , crossed safely into Switzerland ."
g0l-fragment01,116,"They came in cars , army lorries , even an aeroplane ."
g0l-fragment01,117,Their riches were stored in the banks M_under private accounts and then they were brought through Czechoslovakia and East Germany into the Soviet Union . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,118,‰Û÷ All of them ? ‰Ûª asked the DDA .
g0l-fragment01,119,‰Û÷ M_Those who M_broke their word were hunted down . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,120,‰Û÷ And disposed of ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,121,‰Û÷ Some needed reminding that we expected them to M_honour their word . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,122,"It was a M_cold reminder of their world , of the business they M_traded M_in daily ."
g0l-fragment01,123,‰Û÷ We M_had a large colony of Nazis living in the Soviet Union .
g0l-fragment01,124,"They were n't all scientists , M_in fact we M_had little use for most of them ."
g0l-fragment01,125,They had their own estates and farms M_to the west of Moscow .
g0l-fragment01,126,They M_kept their secret identities and paid for it M_through their Swiss bank accounts .
g0l-fragment01,127,"But they remained Germans , always M_dreaming of going back to the Fatherland one day . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,128,‰Û÷ How many Nazis did you take to Russia M_after the war ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,129,"‰Û÷ The Narodnyi Kommissariat Vnutrennikh Del , our People 's Commissariat for Internal Affairs , was M_responsible for ‰ÛÓ ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,130,"‰Û÷ I never M_heard of them , ‰Ûª the DDA M_stopped him ."
g0l-fragment01,131,"‰Û÷ NKVD , ‰Ûª explained the DDI patronizingly ."
g0l-fragment01,132,‰Û÷ M_Wiped M_out twenty million Russians for Stalin .
g0l-fragment01,133,M_That right ? ‰Ûª he M_challenged Sorge .
g0l-fragment01,134,‰Û÷ More .
g0l-fragment01,135,Thirty million .
g0l-fragment01,136,"According to official M_sources , ‰Ûª Sorge riposted ."
g0l-fragment01,137,‰Û÷ A most useful organization . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,138,M_That should shut them up .
g0l-fragment01,139,He M_felt the look of disbelief M_pass M_between the Exec Director and the DDA .
g0l-fragment01,140,"The other just watched him , the mocking smile still M_on his lips ."
g0l-fragment01,141,He would be the one Rostov had warned him to be wary of .
g0l-fragment01,142,He decided to M_wipe the smile M_off his face .
g0l-fragment01,143,‰Û÷ Thirty thousand .
g0l-fragment01,144,M_That 's how many East Germans we deported into the Soviet Union M_after the war . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,145,The DDI 's smile M_disappeared .
g0l-fragment01,146,‰Û÷ Thirty thousand Nazis ?
g0l-fragment01,147,Jesus . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,148,‰Û÷ Yes .
g0l-fragment01,149,And we kept another hundred and twenty thousand M_between 1945 and 1954 in Hitler 's old concentration camps .
g0l-fragment01,150,"Many were Nazis , but businessmen and professionals were also our M_targets ."
g0l-fragment01,151,A third of M_those died .
g0l-fragment01,152,The others were eventually released and M_absorbed M_into the Democratic Republic . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,153,‰Û÷ Including Nazi sympathizers ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,154,‰Û÷ Probably . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,155,‰Û÷ Does n't M_that concern you ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,156,Sorge shrugged .
g0l-fragment01,157,‰Û÷ Not really .
g0l-fragment01,158,I was eight years old M_at the time . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,159,It was n't the answer that the DDI expected and Sorge regretted his words .
g0l-fragment01,160,He was n't here to M_make jokes .
g0l-fragment01,161,"‰Û÷ The thirty thousand in the Soviet Union , as I said , became a M_community M_in their own right ."
g0l-fragment01,162,"M_Without our knowledge , M_over the years , M_with the use of their money and supportive people in the Swiss banks , they M_forged M_contacts M_with M_those left M_behind in East Germany ."
g0l-fragment01,163,They all M_had one M_dream .
g0l-fragment01,164,To M_see a unified Germany .
g0l-fragment01,165,To regain what they had M_lost .
g0l-fragment01,166,They M_had a code-name M_amongst themselves .
g0l-fragment01,167,"Something that M_linked them , was a reminder of how they had M_got M_there ."
g0l-fragment01,168,"It had to be a M_safe name , innocuous , nothing that would M_draw attention M_to the past ."
g0l-fragment01,169,"They remembered the Lucy M_network , their M_gateway out of Germany ."
g0l-fragment01,170,They called themselves Die Lucie Geister . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,171,‰Û÷ The M_Lucy M_Ghosts . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,172,‰Û÷ Yes . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,173,‰Û÷ Did the organization M_extend M_to America ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,174,The Exec Director was alarmed .
g0l-fragment01,175,How the M_hell did they ‰Û_
g0l-fragment01,176,‰Û÷ Goodenache .
g0l-fragment01,177,I guess he was one of them ? ‰Ûª asked the DDI .
g0l-fragment01,178,"‰Û÷ We were n't sure , but in view of his sudden departure , I would say yes . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,179,‰Û÷ Which M_ties Trimmler M_in .
g0l-fragment01,180,And God knows who else .
g0l-fragment01,181,The name Grob Mitzer M_mean anything ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,182,‰Û÷ He was one of their leaders .
g0l-fragment01,183,It was the Lucy Ghosts who supplied him with the cash that M_helped him M_build his M_empire . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,184,‰Û÷ Why did n't you M_stop it ?
g0l-fragment01,185,"Damn it , you knew M_about it for long enough , ‰Ûª M_snapped the Exec Director ."
g0l-fragment01,186,‰Û÷ We did n't realize how important it was .
g0l-fragment01,187,"We thought they were like any other wartime group , nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs ."
g0l-fragment01,188,Old men remembering their youth .
g0l-fragment01,189,The importance of it did n't M_surface until Germany was reunified .
g0l-fragment01,190,And it was only the Englishman overhearing the conversation M_between Goodenache and Trimmler that finally M_bridged the M_gap . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,191,‰Û÷ So why should the English guy take off with the girl ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,192,The DDI M_changed the M_subject .
g0l-fragment01,193,‰Û÷ He 's not one of us .
g0l-fragment01,194,I suggest you M_ask your Allies M_about M_that .
g0l-fragment01,195,Maybe he 's just an adventurer .
g0l-fragment01,196,No more .
g0l-fragment01,197,You must have M_cleared him . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,198,‰Û÷ Of course . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,199,The Exec Director did n't want his M_dirty M_washing M_wrung M_out M_in M_front M_of M_this Russian .
g0l-fragment01,200,‰Û÷ Was there anything else ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,201,"‰Û÷ Only that the GDR , East Germany , as it was , is different M_to the West ."
g0l-fragment01,202,There are still many there who have n't forgotten the war .
g0l-fragment01,203,Their M_attitude is different M_to us .
g0l-fragment01,204,Some are still waiting for the war to end .
g0l-fragment01,205,They 're a traditional people .
g0l-fragment01,206,"Many ex-Nazis , even Gestapo , working and living normal everyday lives . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,207,‰Û÷ Working for the Stasi . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,208,The DDI reminded them all of the secret police who had M_run East Germany M_with an M_iron M_fist .
g0l-fragment01,209,"‰Û÷ Some , yes ."
g0l-fragment01,210,Others M_returned M_to the jobs they M_had M_before the war .
g0l-fragment01,211,"M_Within the M_new Germany , many of them have become frightened ."
g0l-fragment01,212,Their secrets are no longer M_safe .
g0l-fragment01,213,"Most of all , they fear the Israelis . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,214,"‰Û÷ Is Frick one of M_these guys ? ‰Ûª asked the DDA , remembering the name M_picked M_up by Adam in New Orleans ."
g0l-fragment01,215,"‰Û÷ No , ‰Ûª lied Sorge ."
g0l-fragment01,216,His M_orders were quite specific .
g0l-fragment01,217,Do n't ratify any names .
g0l-fragment01,218,They did n't want the Yanks M_stumbling M_in and M_screwing M_up M_in an attempt to M_force the issue .
g0l-fragment01,219,‰Û÷ So what 's all M_this M_got to M_do M_with the deaths of our agents ? ‰Ûª continued the DDA .
g0l-fragment01,220,‰Û÷ We 're not sure .
g0l-fragment01,221,Except that a M_lot of the information we have both M_lost was M_about the Lucy Ghosts .
g0l-fragment01,222,"M_Link M_that M_with Trimmler 's death , Goodenache 's sudden departure for Germany and the mention of the Lucy Ghosts during their conversation , and I think you will agree M_that is the M_strongest M_lead we M_have to M_follow . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,223,"Nobody spoke for a while , then the Exec Director M_reopened the discussion ."
g0l-fragment01,224,‰Û÷ M_Has Moscow any suggestions as to how we should M_proceed ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,225,"‰Û÷ No , ‰Ûª replied Sorge , which was what he 'd been told to say ."
g0l-fragment01,226,‰Û÷ We hoped you would come up with something . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,227,‰Û÷ I 'm sure we will . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,228,‰Û÷ Can you tell us the names of some of M_these Lucy Ghosts ? ‰Ûª cut in the DDI .
g0l-fragment01,229,‰Û÷ The ones in Russia .
g0l-fragment01,230,How M_high M_up the M_ladder did they M_go ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,231,Sorge enjoyed his reply .
g0l-fragment01,232,"‰Û÷ M_In time , yes ."
g0l-fragment01,233,But I can tell you you 're wasting your efforts looking for Martin Bormann in South America .
g0l-fragment01,234,He died twenty years ago . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,235,He watched their M_stunned faces across the room .
g0l-fragment01,236,Well and truly shafted .
g0l-fragment01,237,"They said little M_after M_that and Sorge was soon being escorted , with Nowak , down to the underground garage ."
g0l-fragment01,238,Five minutes later they were on their way M_back to Washington .
g0l-fragment01,239,‰Û÷ Bormann .
g0l-fragment01,240,Fucking Bormann .
g0l-fragment01,241,"They M_had him all the time , ‰Ûª said an astonished DDI ."
g0l-fragment01,242,‰Û÷ Would'ya believe it ?
g0l-fragment01,243,They probably M_got Hitler M_stashed M_away too . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,244,"‰Û÷ Well , it 's been a real eye-opener , ‰Ûª said the Exec Director ."
g0l-fragment01,245,‰Û÷ But let's not forget we 've still M_got a M_crisis M_on .
g0l-fragment01,246,Find the Englishman .
g0l-fragment01,247,M_That 's our first priority .
g0l-fragment01,248,Find him and M_see what the M_son of a M_bitch is M_upM_to . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,249,The AmTrak Crescent Atlanta Georgia
g0l-fragment01,250,"The train pulled out of Atlanta Station M_at 7.39 p.m. , four minutes M_behind schedule ."
g0l-fragment01,251,"They had slept well , eaten well , slept again and eventually got bored M_with the M_passing countryside ."
g0l-fragment01,252,Adam had insisted they stay in the room and she had n't M_found a good enough reason to M_change his mind .
g0l-fragment01,253,"He was thumbing through USA Today for the umpteenth time , looking for something he might have M_missed , when he heard her giggling ."
g0l-fragment01,254,"She was in the swivel chair , reflected in the window M_with the dark night as a M_backdrop , her head angled towards him ."
g0l-fragment01,255,"‰Û÷ What 's so funny ? ‰Ûª he asked pleasantly , putting the paper down ."
g0l-fragment01,256,‰Û÷ You sure know how to M_give a girl a good time . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,257,‰Û÷ Do n't I ? ‰Ûª he grinned M_back .
g0l-fragment01,258,"‰Û÷ According to all the books , a secret agent 's life 's M_meant to be M_glamorous ."
g0l-fragment01,259,"We 've M_spent twenty-four hours together and M_in M_that time I 've been M_bitten by bugs in a hooker 's bed , tied up a guy with no legs and stolen his wheelchair , stayed cooped up in a train for twelve hours with an attractive man and behaved like a virgin ."
g0l-fragment01,260,Do n't M_take M_that the wrong M_way .
g0l-fragment01,261,But James Bond would 've M_handled it differently . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,262,‰Û÷ He was Scottish .
g0l-fragment01,263,I 'm English .
g0l-fragment01,264,They prefer the M_ram 'em and M_bang 'em method .
g0l-fragment01,265,We 're more sophisticated in our M_approach . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,266,‰Û÷ What happens M_next ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,267,‰Û÷ M_In which M_department ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,268,‰Û÷ M_In the where're-we-going M_department . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,269,‰Û÷ To Nordhausen .
g0l-fragment01,270,M_That 's where Trimmler said he would meet Goodenache . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,271,‰Û÷ Trimmler 's dead . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,272,‰Û÷ And Goodenache 's M_running M_from the Russians .
g0l-fragment01,273,He ca n't go back there .
g0l-fragment01,274,"M_From what I M_heard , Germany was still their M_home ."
g0l-fragment01,275,And Nordhausen was where they M_shared something special .
g0l-fragment01,276,They wanted to go there .
g0l-fragment01,277,"If Goodenache 's frightened , and he wants to hide , that 's as good a place as any . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,278,‰Û÷ Nordhausen .
g0l-fragment01,279,Where is M_that ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,280,‰Û÷ Central Germany .
g0l-fragment01,281,"South of Berlin , near what was the M_old East-West M_border ."
g0l-fragment01,282,An industrial town .
g0l-fragment01,283,"It was also where the Nazis built most of their rockets , the V1s and V2s , during the Second World War ."
g0l-fragment01,284,"M_From what I remember , they moved most of the rocket manufacture M_down there so that our bombers could n't M_get M_to them ."
g0l-fragment01,285,Built the factory right M_in the M_heart of the mountains .
g0l-fragment01,286,Used slave labour .
g0l-fragment01,287,"I think a lot of people died M_in the making of M_those weapons , before they ever got launched and M_blew M_up half of London . ‰Ûª"
g0l-fragment01,288,‰Û÷ Why would they want to go back there ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,289,‰Û÷ Who knows .
g0l-fragment01,290,Maybe it was a job they never finished . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,291,‰Û÷ But they did .
g0l-fragment01,292,"M_Those guys M_put people into space , M_put our people on the moon ."
g0l-fragment01,293,M_That 's enough for most people . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,294,‰Û÷ M_That was just their work .
g0l-fragment01,295,And they did n't do it for Germany .
g0l-fragment01,296,They did it for their conquerors . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,297,‰Û÷ You telling me that all M_those scientists M_spent their time in America and could n't wait to get M_home ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,298,‰Û÷ Not all of them .
g0l-fragment01,299,Most of them became good Americans .
g0l-fragment01,300,"And good Russians , I suppose ."
g0l-fragment01,301,But M_these two wanted to go M_home .
g0l-fragment01,302,They never M_stopped being Germans .
g0l-fragment01,303,Maybe it 's the only M_thing they ever M_dreamt M_about . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,304,‰Û÷ Weird . ‰Ûª

g0l-fragment01,326,What 's got you so tickled ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,327,"‰Û÷ Here we are , M_crammed in a small compartment in a train , hurtling across America being M_chased by the CIA , the FBI and God knows who else , and you 're worried M_about your ex-husband 's sex life ."

g0l-fragment01,379,I 'd done something wrong .
g0l-fragment01,380,I remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty .
g0l-fragment01,381,M_That tap M_sorted us both M_out . ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,382,‰Û÷ Do you still M_feel he 's M_with you ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,383,‰Û÷ He is .
g0l-fragment01,384,‰Û÷ Then you 're lucky .
g0l-fragment01,385,You 're not alone .
g0l-fragment01,386,Is M_that so bad ? ‰Ûª
g0l-fragment01,387,‰Û÷ I do n't know why I 'm alive and he 's dead . ‰Ûª

kbc-fragment13,5877,If you wan na M_take it M_that M_way .

kbc-fragment13,5883,John Smith .
kbc-fragment13,5884,"Well erm , they , they do n't know whether they can do it or not do they ?"
kbc-fragment13,5885,"No , but he 's criticizing the Conservative policies and all M_that , and what we will do is M_this ."
kbc-fragment13,5886,I know M_for investment
kbc-fragment13,5887,Yes but they all say M_that
kbc-fragment13,5888,industry
kbc-fragment13,5889,do n't they until they M_get M_into M_power ?
kbc-fragment13,5890,I know .
kbc-fragment13,5891,And and then they all
kbc-fragment13,5892,They do .
kbc-fragment13,5893,Back down .
kbc-fragment13,5894,They do .
kbc-fragment13,5895,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,5896,"They 'll say they , they probably have n't M_got the finances to M_back M_up what they what they said they would do ."
kbc-fragment13,5897,Yeah but a a M_lot of quotes gon na be M_made M_to them M_after are n't there ?
kbc-fragment13,5898,"You know , like you said M_this and you have n't done it , you said M_that and you have n't done it and all M_that sort of ."
kbc-fragment13,5899,Yes but once they 're M_in M_power there 's nothing you

kbc-fragment13,5902,oh admittedly no .
kbc-fragment13,5903,No .

kbc-fragment13,5905,"Well I ca n't well I mean there 's an awful M_lot , I mean would , no , no matter which political party it is , they all M_make promises , but they do n't carry them all out ."
kbc-fragment13,5906,No .
kbc-fragment13,5907,Course not .
kbc-fragment13,5908,"But I mean M_these are , M_these are major M_things ."
kbc-fragment13,5909,M_Getting the economy right .
kbc-fragment13,5910,Now John Smith
kbc-fragment13,5911,But er well John may have
kbc-fragment13,5912,we 'll M_get the economy right .
kbc-fragment13,5913,Now if he does n't M_get the economy right he 's gon na end up M_with M_egg M_on his M_face and
kbc-fragment13,5914,Of course he is .
kbc-fragment13,5915,But you tell me how just how is he going to do it ?
kbc-fragment13,5916,"I mean , ee , they do n't explain M_to you how they 're going to do it do they ?"

kbc-fragment13,5921,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,5922,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,5923,I 'm sure that if there is an easy M_way of doing it the Conservatives would have found out and done it .
kbc-fragment13,5924,I do n't think there 's any any easy M_way .
kbc-fragment13,5925,I do n't M_see how they 're going to do it .
kbc-fragment13,5926,No .
kbc-fragment13,5927,I really do n't .

kbc-fragment13,5929,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,5930,"Or so they say , we 'll M_get eight pound ."
kbc-fragment13,5931,Somebody 's got to pay M_for it .
kbc-fragment13,5932,"So it 'll be the working people , er , probably the the national er , health M_stamp 'll have to go , go up ."
kbc-fragment13,5933,It 'll be a M_sorry day if they M_get M_in .
kbc-fragment13,5934,It will Gordon .

kbc-fragment13,6148,"All , been active all her life ."
kbc-fragment13,6149,"No , you ca n't understand how M_these M_things happen ."
kbc-fragment13,6150,"Well they M_give you all M_these M_bloody M_tips and papers M_about what to do , to M_avoid M_this and M_avoid M_that ."
kbc-fragment13,6151,And what to eat and everything but

kbc-fragment13,6154,a really fit man .
kbc-fragment13,6155,I know .
kbc-fragment13,6156,"He 's , er , one artery was seventy percent blocked , it was M_in the paper ."
kbc-fragment13,6157,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6158,And the other artery was ninety percent blocked .
kbc-fragment13,6159,Was it really ?
kbc-fragment13,6160,Yeah !
kbc-fragment13,6161,Yeah !
kbc-fragment13,6162,Good God !
kbc-fragment13,6163,"I mean , he could have M_gone any time ."
kbc-fragment13,6164,"Graham Sounness , I mean he 's only thirty eight !"
kbc-fragment13,6165,Could have M_gone any time M_with M_with nothing through his M_bloody arteries !
kbc-fragment13,6166,Good God !
kbc-fragment13,6167,But M_that 's I did n't know it was M_that bad .
kbc-fragment13,6168,It was M_in the paper M_this morning .
kbc-fragment13,6169,And er
kbc-fragment13,6170,Goodness me !
kbc-fragment13,6171,"Well he 's a , he , he did n't smoke ."
kbc-fragment13,6172,No .
kbc-fragment13,6173,He was an athlete .
kbc-fragment13,6174,He 's been an athlete .
kbc-fragment13,6175,He obviously ate like everybody else .
kbc-fragment13,6176,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6177,And he
kbc-fragment13,6178,I mean
kbc-fragment13,6179,was n't overweight M_in any M_way .
kbc-fragment13,6180,"Was n't overweight , what more"
kbc-fragment13,6181,No .
kbc-fragment13,6182,the M_bloody M_hell do you have to do !
kbc-fragment13,6183,M_That 's incredible M_that !
kbc-fragment13,6184,M_See they say it was a it 's hereditary .
kbc-fragment13,6185,Well
kbc-fragment13,6186,Cos his father M_had a bypass did n't he ?
kbc-fragment13,6187,Oh did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6188,I think some other relative died er
kbc-fragment13,6189,Oh .
kbc-fragment13,6190,youngish .
kbc-fragment13,6191,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6192,"Oh well I M_bet , I think perhaps it is really ."
kbc-fragment13,6193,I know .
kbc-fragment13,6194,It 's still M_going ?
kbc-fragment13,6195,I know .
kbc-fragment13,6196,"Yeah , and you ca n't , you ca n't understand it can you really ?"
kbc-fragment13,6197,Well M_look M_at the old lady that walks past here M_at ninety one !
kbc-fragment13,6198,"M_That 's right , yeah ."
kbc-fragment13,6199,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6200,And she does all her own shopping .
kbc-fragment13,6201,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6202,"You know , I mean , she keeps stopping but she 's , she 's remarkable !"
kbc-fragment13,6203,She really is .
kbc-fragment13,6204,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6205,But they 're M_few and M_far M_between are n't they ?
kbc-fragment13,6206,When you 're like M_that .
kbc-fragment13,6207,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6208,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6209,But what I could n't understand M_with M_this M_this fella that
kbc-fragment13,6210,M_This Sounness ?
kbc-fragment13,6211,Aye .
kbc-fragment13,6212,"He , he found out cos he went M_for , to , M_for a check up and they M_took his blood pressure ."
kbc-fragment13,6213,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6214,"And well M_lots of people go and have blood pressure M_taken , they M_find it 's M_high , and they"
kbc-fragment13,6215,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6216,give them tablets .
kbc-fragment13,6217,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6218,Go home .
kbc-fragment13,6219,Why did they M_take it a M_stage M_further M_with him ?
kbc-fragment13,6220,"He 'd M_got M_high blood pressure , he was n't M_in any pain he 's living a normal life ."
kbc-fragment13,6221,Similar M_to what I was when I went .
kbc-fragment13,6222,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6223,And they just give me tablets .
kbc-fragment13,6224,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6225,"Now why , what M_made them M_take it M_to the M_stage"
kbc-fragment13,6226,"Well er well , first"
kbc-fragment13,6227,"where , he wanted a heart bypass ?"
kbc-fragment13,6228,first and foremost he was M_in a private scheme .
kbc-fragment13,6229,"Well , probably M_that 's it then ."
kbc-fragment13,6230,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6231,and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative M_having the bypasses done .
kbc-fragment13,6232,So they M_took it
kbc-fragment13,6233,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6234,"a M_step M_further , but I think probably , it 's because he was M_in er er a private scheme ."
kbc-fragment13,6235,Very likely in n it ?
kbc-fragment13,6236,Yes .
kbc-fragment13,6237,So there 's a M_lot of people walking M_about M_with just taking M_bloody tablets who probably really should M_have a bypass .
kbc-fragment13,6238,"Ah well I , well , I would n't say M_that really Gordon ."
kbc-fragment13,6239,"I mean I think er , when your blood pressure was found out and you 'd been taking tablets ever , so , I think it 's M_kept it all M_under control and you 've , you , we eat a sensible diet ."
kbc-fragment13,6240,"The only , the only er M_thing I complained M_about M_with you is , is the butter ."
kbc-fragment13,6241,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6242,I do n't have M_that much now .
kbc-fragment13,6243,"But I think everything M_in moderation , but you do n't eat as much butter now as what you used to ."
kbc-fragment13,6244,I do n't eat M_that much bread you M_see .
kbc-fragment13,6245,No .
kbc-fragment13,6246,"So I , I think really , and I think what I think M_with him , I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family , it M_runs M_in the family ."
kbc-fragment13,6247,Mm mm .
kbc-fragment13,6248,Must be M_hell of a M_shock being told
kbc-fragment13,6249,Oh God !
kbc-fragment13,6250,It must have been .
kbc-fragment13,6251,M_See how much it 's costing ?
kbc-fragment13,6252,Two hundred and fifty pounds a night !
kbc-fragment13,6253,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6254,Phworgh !
kbc-fragment13,6255,M_That 's M_without the operation .
kbc-fragment13,6256,Yeah .
kbc-fragment13,6257,Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then .
kbc-fragment13,6258,Oh I know .
kbc-fragment13,6259,"And plus he 's , he , he , he , he married an heiress you know ."
kbc-fragment13,6260,Did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6261,"Er him er , they live in Spain now ."
kbc-fragment13,6262,"Oh er he , he 's worth a M_pretty M_penny is Sounness ."
kbc-fragment13,6263,"He went in Carl 's shop the other , the other week ."
kbc-fragment13,6264,Did he ?
kbc-fragment13,6265,Yes !
kbc-fragment13,6266,Mm .
kbc-fragment13,6267,Must have been looking M_for a house .
kbc-fragment13,6268,"Carl said he , he looked er well er , his face did , it were very he 's got a very poxy skin ."
kbc-fragment13,6269,Has he ?

kbj-fragment17,1419,Four M_add four and then
kbj-fragment17,1420,Four M_add four equals eight .
kbj-fragment17,1421,"Two times four equals eight , right ?"
kbj-fragment17,1422,"Yeah , like that ."
kbj-fragment17,1423,And then two
kbj-fragment17,1424,And two times four is eight .
kbj-fragment17,1425,Erm I did n't write it like that then .
kbj-fragment17,1426,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1427,M_Share the total of fives
kbj-fragment17,1428,"Yeah , I done , yeah I done"
kbj-fragment17,1429,Er
kbj-fragment17,1430,"Five , five , five is fifteen ."
kbj-fragment17,1431,Five M_add five M_add five
kbj-fragment17,1432,Erm is fifteen .
kbj-fragment17,1433,and then erm .
kbj-fragment17,1434,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1435,Is fifteen .
kbj-fragment17,1436,And then
kbj-fragment17,1437,And sixes
kbj-fragment17,1438,Sixes six
kbj-fragment17,1439,
kbj-fragment17,1440,M_add six M_add six
kbj-fragment17,1441,M_add six
kbj-fragment17,1442,M_add six
kbj-fragment17,1443,is thirty six .
kbj-fragment17,1444,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1445,Six times six is thirty
kbj-fragment17,1446,I 've done that one .
kbj-fragment17,1447,sixes .
kbj-fragment17,1448,M_That 's it .
kbj-fragment17,1449,Okay ?
kbj-fragment17,1450,Erm this .
kbj-fragment17,1451,I 'll leave that out .
kbj-fragment17,1452,Leave that out .
kbj-fragment17,1453,Add them up .
kbj-fragment17,1454,Mm .
kbj-fragment17,1455,That much closer can use those pictures .
kbj-fragment17,1456,M_Take a look .
kbj-fragment17,1457,Are they near the box ?
kbj-fragment17,1458,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1459,Is M_that right ?
kbj-fragment17,1460,Four
kbj-fragment17,1461,Four is twenty !
kbj-fragment17,1462,So it 's four so
kbj-fragment17,1463,Four times five is
kbj-fragment17,1464,Twenty !
kbj-fragment17,1465,Four times five equal twenty .
kbj-fragment17,1466,Er two times six equals twelve .
kbj-fragment17,1467,Er four times three equal twelve .
kbj-fragment17,1468,"Er , two M_additions M_left ."
kbj-fragment17,1469,Alright .
kbj-fragment17,1470,Those two M_add ?
kbj-fragment17,1471,"So it 's like one , two , one , two and one there and but put like erm seven M_add seven M_add seven is ."
kbj-fragment17,1472,Is twenty one .
kbj-fragment17,1473,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1474,Seven M_add seven M_add seven is twenty one
kbj-fragment17,1475,One .
kbj-fragment17,1476,And three times seven
kbj-fragment17,1477,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1478,"is twenty one and do it M_that M_way , five and fives ."
kbj-fragment17,1479,Okay ?
kbj-fragment17,1480,Two M_addition questions .
kbj-fragment17,1481,M_Hang M_on .
kbj-fragment17,1482,Two yeah but you 've got right two multiple and two M_addition equations .
kbj-fragment17,1483,Not equations !
kbj-fragment17,1484,You told us M_this !
kbj-fragment17,1485,"But , like these , these are equations ."
kbj-fragment17,1486,So two M_addition equations er three times seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one .
kbj-fragment17,1487,Right ?
kbj-fragment17,1488,Oh !
kbj-fragment17,1489,"so , but you can also M_go"
kbj-fragment17,1490,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1491,Yeah M_add three .
kbj-fragment17,1492,Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one .
kbj-fragment17,1493,Do it M_that M_way M_on .
kbj-fragment17,1494,Do you M_follow
kbj-fragment17,1495,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1496,me ?
kbj-fragment17,1497,Yes I do .
kbj-fragment17,1498,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1499,Two multiplication
kbj-fragment17,1500,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1501,and two M_addition .
kbj-fragment17,1502,Two M_addition .
kbj-fragment17,1503,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1504,"So you , like , you ."
kbj-fragment17,1505,"Yes , M_that 's right ."
kbj-fragment17,1506,"Then , it 's like erm"
kbj-fragment17,1507,One .
kbj-fragment17,1508,"seven times three , and three times seven ."
kbj-fragment17,1509,And three times seven .
kbj-fragment17,1510,M_That 's right .
kbj-fragment17,1511,And you do the same there .
kbj-fragment17,1512,Same M_on the M_adds .
kbj-fragment17,1513,"And then , this we do like"
kbj-fragment17,1514,"Right , she wants currency M_in two M_divisions M_in each , right ?"
kbj-fragment17,1515,"So it 's one , two , three , four ,"
kbj-fragment17,1516,That multiplication is a
kbj-fragment17,1517,"yeah well M_divisions , okay , so it 's twenty one M_shared by say , if that 's one , two , three , four , five , six int it ?"
kbj-fragment17,1518,Oh I know what I 've M_got !
kbj-fragment17,1519,Six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen .
kbj-fragment17,1520,I know what I 've done .
kbj-fragment17,1521,"I 've put the , I thought it was er okay ."
kbj-fragment17,1522,Six .
kbj-fragment17,1523,And M_division is M_shared by .
kbj-fragment17,1524,So you got to do eighteen M_shared by six is three and eighteen
kbj-fragment17,1525,Have you got
kbj-fragment17,1526,M_shared by three is six .
kbj-fragment17,1527,"So like , you M_go one , two , three , four , five , six six times you M_swap"
kbj-fragment17,1528,Three .
kbj-fragment17,1529,six times three
kbj-fragment17,1530,times three is eighteen
kbj-fragment17,1531,is three times six .
kbj-fragment17,1532,Six .
kbj-fragment17,1533,"Yeah , and and you got"
kbj-fragment17,1534,Six times three and three times six .
kbj-fragment17,1535,"and M_division is eighteen M_shared by three is six , and eighteen M_shared by six is three !"
kbj-fragment17,1536,Yeah ?
kbj-fragment17,1537,M_Got it ?
kbj-fragment17,1538,I can not read .
kbj-fragment17,1539,Three sixes are eighteen !
kbj-fragment17,1540,You M_got it ?
kbj-fragment17,1541,And you do the same there ?
kbj-fragment17,1542,M_Hang M_on !
kbj-fragment17,1543,I have n't finished thirty three
kbj-fragment17,1544,one yet .
kbj-fragment17,1545,M_That 's what I do n't M_get .
kbj-fragment17,1546,Why do multiplication equation for this similar M_line I do n't M_get how you do M_that ?
kbj-fragment17,1547,"Is it , would you like us to put"
kbj-fragment17,1548,It 's fours int it ?
kbj-fragment17,1549,It 's fours
kbj-fragment17,1550,"No two , four , six , eight , ten , twelve"
kbj-fragment17,1551,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1552,It
kbj-fragment17,1553,That 's twos .
kbj-fragment17,1554,"No , but it 's M_going M_to fours look ."
kbj-fragment17,1555,It 's M_going M_to fours .
kbj-fragment17,1556,Alright .
kbj-fragment17,1557,M_Going M_into fours .
kbj-fragment17,1558,What would I M_put ?
kbj-fragment17,1559,"Er one four is four , two fours are eight , and three fours is twelve ."
kbj-fragment17,1560,As this is been M_shared by M_lines int it ?
kbj-fragment17,1561,Yeah and it 's M_on that one .
kbj-fragment17,1562,You do it like M_that do you ?
kbj-fragment17,1563,"Yeah , cos it 's being M_shared by"
kbj-fragment17,1564,Oh !
kbj-fragment17,1565,"So it 's , I would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six ."
kbj-fragment17,1566,"And M_on that one is er , sixty three M_shared by nine six time sixty three M_divided by nine"
kbj-fragment17,1567,four .
kbj-fragment17,1568,No !
kbj-fragment17,1569,Sixty three M_divided by nine is six !
kbj-fragment17,1570,Write six through it .
kbj-fragment17,1571,Ten six in n it ?
kbj-fragment17,1572,"No , it 's ten sixes ."
kbj-fragment17,1573,"No , no wait a minute ."
kbj-fragment17,1574,Nines .
kbj-fragment17,1575,What should nine times ten Emma ?
kbj-fragment17,1576,"One nine is nine , two nines are eighteen , three nines are"
kbj-fragment17,1577,Twenty seven .
kbj-fragment17,1578,"Four nines are thirty six , five nines are forty five , six nines fifty four , seven nine are sixty three ."
kbj-fragment17,1579,Oh thank you .
kbj-fragment17,1580,Right .
kbj-fragment17,1581,"Yeah , seven nines are sixty three ."
kbj-fragment17,1582,M_Hang M_on a minute !
kbj-fragment17,1583,Six nines are
kbj-fragment17,1584,seven nines are sixty three .
kbj-fragment17,1585,M_Hang M_on a minute !
kbj-fragment17,1586,Seven
kbj-fragment17,1587,Seven nines are sixty three !
kbj-fragment17,1588,Sixty three .
kbj-fragment17,1589,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1590,You work them out like that look .
kbj-fragment17,1591,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1592,"Well seven nines , well ee er , it M_takes you so long"
kbj-fragment17,1593,"Look one , one nine is nine"
kbj-fragment17,1594,Yeah .
kbj-fragment17,1595,Two nines are eighteen .
kbj-fragment17,1596,So that one there is sixes M_into thirty six .
kbj-fragment17,1597,I know !
kbj-fragment17,1598,But I still do n't M_get what you have to write !
kbj-fragment17,1599,Well multiplication equation for this number M_line I would say is er I 've already told you M_that .
kbj-fragment17,1600,"No , but I do n't know what I have to , I have to write !"
kbj-fragment17,1601,Eight times four equals thirty six .
kbj-fragment17,1602,Do n't M_get it .
kbj-fragment17,1603,"Because it 's one , two , three , four , five , six , seven eight , no sorry , nine times four is thirty six ."
kbj-fragment17,1604,Nine times four equals thirty six .
kbj-fragment17,1605,Like this look !
kbj-fragment17,1606,Write it out on a piece of paper and you 'll and I 'll write them down .

kbw-fragment11,4147,Will she have watched Inspector Morse ?
kbw-fragment11,4148,"She wo n't of watched it , cos it 's M_bound to be M_on a Wednesday night !"
kbw-fragment11,4149,Does she like Inspector Morse ?
kbw-fragment11,4150,I do n't think she watches it normally .
kbw-fragment11,4151,"No , she probably does n't like it ."
kbw-fragment11,4152,A bit M_spicy !
kbw-fragment11,4153,"I M_bet she would , she loves anything like M_that !"
kbw-fragment11,4154,M_Bit of a M_body !
kbw-fragment11,4155,"Mind you , it might be too complicated !"
kbw-fragment11,4156,"It was I remember reading M_in the paper that it 's been it 's been filmed at a house which no one 's ever been allowed to go in even the M_great sort of one of M_these country mansions , it was not"
kbw-fragment11,4157,Right .
kbw-fragment11,4158,And even people who write M_about
kbw-fragment11,4159,"If it was not , it ca n't be again , they 're always going in there !"
kbw-fragment11,4160,Well M_that 's M_fine .
kbw-fragment11,4161,It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire you know ?
kbw-fragment11,4162,Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4163,It 's as you come off the
kbw-fragment11,4164,And how did
kbw-fragment11,4165,and
kbw-fragment11,4166,they M_get permission then ?
kbw-fragment11,4167,"They somehow M_managed to persuade the owners , apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in M_this place not even erm historians who write M_about famous buildings , even they had been refused access !"
kbw-fragment11,4168,Where is it ?
kbw-fragment11,4169,Somewhere in Oxfordshire .
kbw-fragment11,4170,Oh !
kbw-fragment11,4171,They do n't know where ?
kbw-fragment11,4172,Oh .
kbw-fragment11,4173,So
kbw-fragment11,4174,M_this was M_about last week 's episode ?
kbw-fragment11,4175,"I think it was M_about last week 's , but they seem to imply that it was last week 's episode that would"
kbw-fragment11,4176,Oh .
kbw-fragment11,4177,M_do it .
kbw-fragment11,4178,We seem to have got one spare video if we do n't get it watched M_before Wednesday .
kbw-fragment11,4179,Alright .
kbw-fragment11,4180,Well M_that 's the only chance .
kbw-fragment11,4181,Oh yeah cos we 're going to Maryland tomorrow .
kbw-fragment11,4182,your dad .
kbw-fragment11,4183,Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4184,"Erm not it was n't M_about your dad , it was M_about my birthday cos"
kbw-fragment11,4185,Cos
kbw-fragment11,4186,"he 'd realized that it was my birthday , and , what did I want ?"
kbw-fragment11,4187,So I said send me a cheque and I 'll go and shop .
kbw-fragment11,4188,And ?
kbw-fragment11,4189,And last week cos she 's quite generous is n't she ?
kbw-fragment11,4190,She is a bit but it 's .
kbw-fragment11,4191,"No , I did n't say anything ."
kbw-fragment11,4192,I think M_that 's the M_thing .
kbw-fragment11,4193,So your dad sent a cheque .
kbw-fragment11,4194,"Anyway I asked her if she 'd heard from your dad , and she has heard from your dad apparently M_on Friday he went to the consultant"
kbw-fragment11,4195,Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4196,and M_next week he 's M_got his first well she did n't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy .
kbw-fragment11,4197,And she said he has to go M_trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now .
kbw-fragment11,4198,Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4199,"I do n't know how long it 's going to M_go M_on for , or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and M_see ."
kbw-fragment11,4200,Mm .
kbw-fragment11,4201,"But at least M_things have M_moved , and at least they 've gone round ."
kbw-fragment11,4202,"So I 'm pleased really , are you ?"
kbw-fragment11,4203,Interesting that they 've done it so M_quickly is n't it ?
kbw-fragment11,4204,"M_After seeing him , because he thought that once he 'd seen the consultant it would then M_take some time to get the treatment started , but they must have M_got themselves M_over M_that ."
kbw-fragment11,4205,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4206,Well I mean everyone .
kbw-fragment11,4207,Yeah .
kbw-fragment11,4208,I think .
kbw-fragment11,4209,Got ta M_get M_moving .
kbw-fragment11,4210,"And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him has had , M_upset M_that thrombosis again ."
kbw-fragment11,4211,"I do n't know whether to ring him tonight , oh it 's too late tonight now ."
kbw-fragment11,4212,It 's much too late .
kbw-fragment11,4213,Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are M_up ?
kbw-fragment11,4214,Well they love talking M_to them M_on the phone do n't they ?
kbw-fragment11,4215,I know they do .
kbw-fragment11,4216,We could can M_prime them M_up M_on what to say and types of M_things to talk M_about so they do n't get moaned M_down or something !
kbw-fragment11,4217,M_Bogged M_down !
kbw-fragment11,4218,"So he 's had to go in , what did you say ?"
kbw-fragment11,4219,Three times a week ?
kbw-fragment11,4220,I do n't know she just said
kbw-fragment11,4221,Something like M_that
kbw-fragment11,4222,a few times a week and I think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope M_with driving and everything .
kbw-fragment11,4223,Mm a trial !
kbw-fragment11,4224,Well I hope not I mean no he wo n't be able to drive
kbw-fragment11,4225,"but presumably your mum can do M_that for , they 've M_got hundreds of people there , he 's always driving people everywhere"
kbw-fragment11,4226,M_That 's right .
kbw-fragment11,4227,so I do n't M_see why they ca n't drive him !
kbw-fragment11,4228,I 'm sure they will
kbw-fragment11,4229,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4230,cos they 're very good are n't they ?
kbw-fragment11,4231,I mean M_look M_at M_that woman doing her er from the from the church .
kbw-fragment11,4232,M_At times like M_this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out .
kbw-fragment11,4233,It would nice if we lived there but we ca n't so
kbw-fragment11,4234,It 's about .
kbw-fragment11,4235,And write as well .
kbw-fragment11,4236,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4237,Double dose .
kbw-fragment11,4238,Yes .
kbw-fragment11,4239,And pulled out .
kbw-fragment11,4240,"Well it 's sort of pulled out , but at least it 's ."
kbw-fragment11,4241,We 'll be paying for it as well .
kbw-fragment11,4242,And it 's M_hard as well .
kbw-fragment11,4243,"We 've been paying anyway , so it must of you know ."
kbw-fragment11,4244,What does erm you M_see er Eileen 's and she 's M_having chemotherapy is n't she ?
kbw-fragment11,4245,"By , by medication , is"
kbw-fragment11,4246,M_that right ?
kbw-fragment11,4247,Well she takes all M_these tablet things .
kbw-fragment11,4248,M_That 's right she has a sort of M_massive dose every now and then .
kbw-fragment11,4249,And M_that M_makes her M_feel what ?
kbw-fragment11,4250,She 's not M_in pain is she ?
kbw-fragment11,4251,More sort of dopey .
kbw-fragment11,4252,I would n't care if they M_made me dazed
kbw-fragment11,4253,Yeah .

kbw-fragment11,4258,Difficult to know .
kbw-fragment11,4259,"Oh yes , M_that was it !"
kbw-fragment11,4260,"I wonder how bad it is , M_that feeling 's like , we do n't really know how bad it is do we ?"
kbw-fragment11,4261,No .
kbw-fragment11,4262,"Perhaps he will be able to say , you know ?"
kbw-fragment11,4263,"But whether he 'd tell us M_over the telephone , you think ask ."
kbw-fragment11,4264,I think he would would n't he ?
kbw-fragment11,4265,I think so .
kbw-fragment17,5989,Cos we 've M_got the AGM M_in two weeks time
kbw-fragment17,5990,Mm .
kbw-fragment17,5991,and we voted all M_these people that are here
kbw-fragment17,5992,What type of this ?
